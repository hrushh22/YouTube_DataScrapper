Nahin marna ganwaara pyaar
Mein tum se ye kehana hai
Tumhe bhi zinda rehana hai
Mujhe bhi zinda rehana hai

Kabhi aasaan kabhi mushkil
Ajab hai pyaar ki raahe
Kabhi aasaan kabhi mushkil
Ajab hai pyaar ki raahe
Magar jo pyaar karate hain
Kabhi bharate nahin aahen
Hawaao ne ye kaha
Fizaao ne ye kaha
Aai pyaar ki ye rrut badi
Tufaani tu darna na o meri rani
Badalega ye mausam ari deewaani
Ham likhenge prem kahani
Kabhi aasaan kabhi mushkil
Ajab hai pyaar ki raahe
Kabhi aasaan kabhi mushkil
Ajab hai pyaar ki raahe
Magar jo pyaar karate hain

Kabhi bharate nahin aahen
Hawaao ne ye kaha
Fizaao ne ye kaha
Aai pyaar ki ye rrut badi
Tufaani tu darna na o meri rani
Badalega ye mausam ari deewaani
Ham likhenge prem kahani

Gardish me hi sahi ye
Sitaare hamnashin
Gardish me hi sahi ye
Sitaare hamnashin
Dhoondhegi kal hame ye
Bahaare hamnashin
Imtehaan pyaar
Ke roz hote nahin
Pyaar waale kabhi
Sabr khote nahi
Mohabbat ho hi jaati hai
Mohabbat ki nahi jaati
Ye aisi chiz hai jo sabake
Hisse me nahi aati

@LadyGaga 



(Lyrics):
[Intro: Lady Gaga]
(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars]
Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only one worth fighting for

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars]
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga]
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

[Bridge: Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga & Both]
Right next to you
Next to you
Right next to you
Oh-oh
[Chorus: Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars, Bruno Mars]
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

[Outro: Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars]
(Ooh, ooh)
I'd wanna be next to you

Video Transcript:

I love I you.

now before you laugh or make fun of me, or just think I'm weird,

let me tell you what I mean by that first.

I don’t mean it in some fake, warm and fuzzy, sentimental kind of way. 

And I’m not saying it just to be nice, or to look good, or to get you to like me. 

What I mean is, at the very least, I only want what is good for you. 

At the very most, I mean, i'll give myself, my life, in any way I can, for your good.

And I don’t care how I feel, or how I look, or what Im getting out of it, 

or if I feel like it or not.

Love doesn't go this way.  

Only this way. 

And who are you?

Well you could be anyone.

my friend, my family, my spouse, person I like. 

well thats easy, anyone can love the people they like.   

What about the person I don't like, the person who doesn't like me, the person nobody likes,

what about the person I totally disagree with, the person who's completely different from me, there person I want to hate, the person everyone hates, the person who repulses me.

DOESN'T matter.

Love doesn't pick and choose who to love, just like the sun doesn’t pick and choose who to shine on, it just shines.

And what is your good?

Well it's all those little things that are gonna help us find the one thing that we all want, that we’re all searching for, 

happiness.

as much as we can find here in this life, but more importantly, the full happiness that we can only find in the next life.

and I'll love you no matter what you do, 

but that doesn't mean I’m going to love everything you do. 

Love has to be tough, sometimes even fierce.

If you do anything that's gonna harm, impede, poison, delay or divert your good, 

or the good of anyone else's, 

I have to stand against it, not you.

Even if it's awkward, even if it's unpopular, even if it's gonna turn you against me, 

for a little while. 

But even when love is tough,  

Love is always patient. 

That's why we have a whole lifetime. 

love is always gentle, kind, tender, loving, 

never pushy, preachy, pointing fingers, rigid or mean.

and I don’t care what you’ve done, or how big you've screwed up, or how vast our differences are, or if your life is a giant, global sized disaster.  

love is bigger than all these things.  

And I don't care how worthless, or flawed, or unlovable, or insignificant, you think you may be.  

love breaks through all these.  

and if you get hurt, which we do, 

or get into trouble, which we do, 

or get beat up by the world, which we will.  

and you're tired, and angry, and bitter, and miserable, and scared, LIKE THE REST OF US, 

and feel like you’re, drifting all alone in a sea of, suffering… 

ill suffer with you.  

and if we disagree and get into those epic fights, which we will, 

and even if you betray me, and laugh at me, and make me look stupid, 

and walk away a thousand times,

Ill forgive you, a million times,

because nothing that could ever happen in this tiny little universe, 

could ever be more important to me than you.  

Not even myself.  

This is what I mean when I say I love you…

but this is not my love…

my love is weak, and self-centered at best.  

this is his love.  

and he said, he commanded, 

go out there and love one another as I loved you.

so I'll say it say again even though I know i'm gonna fail at it a million times today.

Lana Del Rey - Love (Lyrics)

Look at you, kids, with your vintage music
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusin'

It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes it's enough just to make you feel crazy

You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

Look at you, kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues, but
That don't mean that you should abuse it

Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

But you get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
It don't matter because it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby

And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy

I get ready, I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
It doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love, ah, ah
I'm young and in love, ah, ah, ah, ah

Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm

Sagittarius let's see what do we have for [Applause] [Music] you so we have I I have to let go I have to let you go to find myself I'm going crazy without you I want to see you so bad my f my finances are a mess I've made bad decisions I am in the process of turning things [Music] around this was a hard lesson I needed to learn I was out of control I need to figure myself out it's interesting because it's very similar energy isn't it I have to let you go to find myself I need to figure out myself out so you have someone here Sagittarius [Music] who who is complicating things a lot I feel the reason why they are complicating things and they might be a mess is because for some of you this person indeed created some sort of situations and they made a bad decisions financial decisions and they don't know what to do they don't know how to handle it and that really affected this whole situation they are missing you though if there is no contact situation this person is claiming here that they really want to see you very badly and it's like yeah they subconscious is saying here Sagittarius it was a lesson it was a hard lesson I needed to learn yeah I feel this person maybe I'm getting here that you might be dealing with someone who's convinced that they know best they made a decision that really was quite devastating for them irresp if it was financial decision or whatever decision that might be but it really really impacted I feel this person's life and also uh romantic life meaning disconnection mhm I feel this person is now trying to figure not themselves but it's like they trying to figure out they they are trying to figure out this whole situation you know trying to figure out things but this is someone who complicates stuff and there is no need for them to do that let's see could you please show me this person's energy and feelings towards Sagittarius and this connection please Queen of Pentacles uh Temperance Knight of Cups 10 of Swords mhm seven of Swords five of Wands the emperor the hangedman and Eight of Cups there is something think about this person being unable to handle what they've created and I feel it took a kind of a tool on you if I can say it that way what I mean by this I feel that this person kind of projected all this frustration that they had onto you 10 of Swords suggests here that with the seven of swords for some yeah for some of you this is someone who got uh played essentially someone promised them something it didn't deliver they didn't deliver and five of Wands this person obviously got very frustrated angry they didn't know how to handle it yeah but indeed something here ended and it also affect fected this connection we have this is a Queen of Pentacles okay Temperance and Knight of Cups I feel this person feel a little bit foolish because I'm seeing you telling them think twice do you think it's a good idea and it's like they didn't listen I feel that you were the one saying listen take your time think about this there is no need to rush yeah I'm seeing you saying this Temperance is your energy Sagittarius and I feel that you've tried to be very kind of grounded very supportive very kind I feel that your delivery was very kind to them but this is someone who refused to listen and this is where we are at the moment or to be more precise they are we have the EMP the hman and Eight of Cups yeah I'm seeing this person now completely seeing things from a different perspective this Emperor is seeing things differently M Eight of Cups there is something here about I feel that whatever here happened in their life it triggered them to walked away from something or many things that just didn't make them happy it's like this person is decluttering emotions that's what I am getting Sagittarius you might be dealing with Pisces we have your energy so you might be dealing with another Sagittarius and we also have Aries excuse me let's see could you please show me sagittarius's energy and feelings towards this person and this connection please we have two of Cups love king of cups I think that was let's see your energy towards this person in this connection Sagittarius Three of Swords nine of Pentacles Queen of Wands Ace of Pentacles The Chariot and the tower they really broke your heart King Of Wands and kn eight of Swords okay eight of Pentacles yeah I feel you know I'm getting here Sagittarius that you are that for a lot of you you might be heartbroken you know over over what happened between the two of you with the nine of Pentacles I feel that you're trying to focus on yourself trying to focus on things that makes you happy but three of ss you know with the nine of Pentacles suggests here that this person made a selfish decision and the repr cussions of their actions really really impacted this connection we have this Queen of Wands but we have King Of Wands I feel that there is enormous attraction between the two of you chemistry might be very intense and you might see this person as a match but at the moment I feel that you are heartbroken also it's like I feel that you are heartbroken over the fact that this person at some point prioritize something else over this connection you know and I feel that there was a moment there was a time when you saw this connection as an opportunity um for progress in a sense of I feel that you kind of you I'm getting oh gosh I wanted to say it properly it's like I feel that there was at some there was a moment when you felt that it's like what you wanted was within the rich of your hand you know with this Ace of Pentacles and you felt like finally things will move on now will I will see progress with the Chariot but something here happened with the tower and it stopped that progress something unexpected something out of the blue and it changed things it changed things drastically mhm so we have King Of Wands Knight of Swords with the the eight of Pentacles I'm getting here based on your energy that this is someone who will have to really prove it to you that they care that they willing to to work on the situation that they want that they really want to work things out with you you know that they really want to put an effort and they really need to try with the Knight of Swords and eight of Pentacles they charm will get them so far at this stage of this connection I feel that it's that is how you see the situation Sagittarius you might be dealing with um we have strong fire uh energy so another Sagittarius right Aries Leo we have Scorpio let's see the outcome could you please show me the outcome [Music] we have Page of Cups King of Swords king of Cups ace of cups eight of Wands Wheel of Fortune and four of cups The Hermit the lovers and the two of swords as an overall energy for this reading I feel that the love is still there between the two of you I feel this person has love for you I feel that you have love for them with the lovers at the moment both of you might be in a Hermit mode trying to figure out things um and with the two of Swords it feels like there is a stalemate because of what happened mhm so we have page of cups cups King of Swords and king of cups I see this person actually reaching out to you Sagittarius and expressing their feelings for you mhm Page of Cups King of Swords that's communication of affection and king of Cups expressing feelings this person has love for you they want to tell you about they want to share it with you that they have this love for you it's like they want to reassure you Ace of cups is a bonding energy there will be an opportunity for a new beginning for a new beginning in love with this person I see this person coming here with an offer of love and peace you know they for some of you this is someone who will apologize and we have eight of Wands The Wheel of Fortune and four of cups things will change for some of you if there is a physical distance between the two of you um I see this person taking action and eight of Wands it's a very action orientated card will of Fortune put things into motion however we have a four of cups I'm not seeing you 100% satisfied it's like I feel that um this person will be in touch with you and things going to change for the better but for you it might be a case that it's not good enough you know everything is subjective right for someone that might be good enough but for the other person it might not be good enough and that's the thing and I feel with the four of cups you might feel like well I appreciate the effort I appreciate you wanting to bring a change to the situation but it's like you need to try it harder it can be as simple as that but there will be a change there will be a change of course it will depend on you Sagittarius if the if this change it's just the beginning uh and if you want to you know invest more in this beginning or if it's just simply not good enough okay so you might be dealing with Aquarius taus Scorpio Leo we have Virgo we have Gemini yeah and your energy actually is Sagittarius so we have more of your energy Sagittarius therefore you might be dealing with another Sagittarius crosswatchers the roles can be reversed Sagittarius I will leave it here thank you so so very much for being with me please like share and subscribe and once again thank you very much for your time I truly truly appreciate you Sagittarius have a fantastic and absolutely gorgeous day and once again thank you very very much for being with me I am sending you much much love till next time take care

itself you don't want to go through that emotional upheaval yeah because I feel that it took you quite some time to get over a certain one a specific one but at the same time I feel that you cannot help how you feel about this person and with the sun I feel that this person makes you feel happy but but there is something here about you being also quiet guarded because you don't fully trust this person it's like you might be seeing them a little bit wishy-washy or they are not sharing much about their past and it's like I feel that you are more concerned here about their intentions it's like you don't fully trust this person it's like is this person is for the right reasons with me or in my life I feel that's the case but I'm seeing you giving it a time and there is something here for some of you might feel like time will tell time always tell that's how it's been always mhm we have King Of Wands we have eight of swords and nine of Swords yeah I feel this is this this this feeling of uncertainty uncertainty it's seriously playing on your [Music] mind I feel that you're thinking a lot about this person but there is something here about something is stressing you out I feel Leo

trickster they are not fully transparent again with you it's like they're hiding they might be having Secrets I feel that you you just don't trust their motives Justice with the four of Wands but there is a just such strong it's just odd this this Dynamic is very very strange because is it's like you don't I feel that you don't trust them they don't know how you feel about them they don't they have abandonment issues they cannot let go of you but at the same time they want best for you oh my gosh it's 10 of Wands as a bonding energy here this card is showing it's tiring it's draining it's exhausting and it's a hard work this connection and yeah I feel that they have serious intentions but it's like there is some sort of kind of energy of I feel that this is you feeling not sure about this person's intentions yes I will leave it there because I'm repeating myself we have seven of Swords two of Cups and Knight of Swords you're dealing here with someone who's very strategic and I feel that they are like this because the circumstances in their life in their life forc them to be um I'm seeing this person wanting very much to be with you I'm seeing them chasing you and this connection and the Seven of Swords here it's it's more about this person's um tactics in order to be with you they don't want you to let go of them they don't want you to walk away and I feel this person can manipulate circumstances situations in order for you to stay with them because they want this connection very very much and this is where I was getting that kind of trickster energy but it's it's more than that it's not that surface level it's it's more complex than this because I'm seeing someone who seriously cares a lot about you they want to be with you and they are ready to kind of to use manipulation in order to have the reassurance that you will not walked away that's what I am getting here Leo then we have four of cups 10 of Cups and the lovers I see relationship you know I see a relationship I see love between the two of you but this four of cups it's showing me that there will be aspects or there will be something here you that you might not feel that optimistic about with the four of cups it's like something it's not working and it's like love is there connection is there but something brings the satisfaction and I believe that you know best what that might be based on your circumstances it's like we can have this 10 of Cups and the lovers which is beautiful it's just loving happy relationship and yet there is the four of cups something it's kind of not working 100% as it should for this connection and if you resonate with this reading irrespective if I mention you sign of zodiac or not or not but if you resonate with this reading that's your message obviously but you know exactly what that is that's what they telling me and I feel with the lovers you will have to make a decision with regards to the future of this connection Leo it doesn't have to be you know in a near future immediate future but um I feel this is a very complex relationship very complex very very complex but I'm seeing you being you know spending really nice time together with the lovers and 10 of Cups full of love and and and closeness you know very very [Music] beautiful Leo you might be dealing with Virgo Gemini uh Libra mhm yes Libra crosswatchers of course the roles can be reverse Leo I will leave it here thank you so so very much for being with me please like share and subscribe and once again thank you very much for your time I truly truly appreciate you Leo have a fantastic and absolutely gorgeous day and once again thank you very much for being with me I am sending you much much love till next time take care bye,{}

Thank you Justine & Michael 💚

Back in December 2022, we released a film featuring Antony and Margie, who shared with us some of their views on love and relationships. If you haven't seen this first film, you can watch it here - https://youtu.be/pbyQhbZJhwI

Following the overwhelming response to our initial video, we've received many messages asking for further glimpses into the lives of this fabulous couple. Your voices have been heard, and so we recently visited with them again. During our latest encounter, Antony and Margie chat more about the various stages of married life, and some of their secrets to a successful marriage. Their reflections are sure to resonate deeply with those of you who are seeking guidance on matters of the heart.

“An outstanding love doesn’t come from two half-fulfilled people coming together to make one whole, complete life. Outstanding love comes from two whole people coming together to share and enhance their already full and beautiful lives.” ~Pia Scade

Filmed in Colesburg, South Africa. 
Featuring Antony and Margie Osler (https://www.stoepzen.co.za/accommodation.html)

What is love Antony?  What is love? This is about as good as it gets. And it seems to get better as we get older. But there will probably be a tipping point where we don’t know what’s going to happen and we’ll just have to be willing to slide together down some slippery slope. When we got married we worked out a series of vows which we wrote out and we said to each other. I can’t really remember what they were except that it was something like that we hope one day we will sit here in our old age still together and just enjoy this life that we’ve been given. Maybe we do need to renew our vows so that we remember what we said. But the one that stands out quite strongly which I feel we’re embodying now is, ‘May our home be a place where people can accept themselves.’ Which, when we drew that up, was a beautiful intention and I feel like we’re really living that. The other was that we don’t hide behind each other. That we have our own identity and are at one with ourselves. That we’re not hiding behind another person or expecting them to fulfil what is important to us. What is often hard to accept when you live so much inside yourself is that the person in front of you is very different to you. I think in a marriage that’s the hardest thing... to realise that some of the differences that you fell in love with in the beginning are the things that bug you later. I’ve seen that in myself and with others. So those are the little daily things that need to be communicated and sat down and made a compromise.  I see that if I leave the butter out after I make toast that my wife is furious... daily. Then I think the one way I can show a commitment to the relationship is to either not have toast at all, or to have toast without butter, or to put the butter away. And I don’t have to talk to her about it, I don’t have to be analytical about it, you know, one picks it up. And of course there are things I do that will infuriate her  that I don’t pick up. She’ll tell me... she’s not scared of me in that way. If I look back, there are stages in a married life. There’s the initial excitement of being together. And then of course the utter astonishment of having children. That was just wonderful, beyond measure. Sometimes it was really hard work. We had to earn a living. I had to travel to work. There were times we had to be apart, times we came together. And we didn’t resist it or complain... we just did it. And in retrospect that doing of it was a wonderful cementing of the relationship. Since then I’ve stopped travelling. We spend all our time together now, pretty much. We sleep together, we eat together, we drink together. And it’s wonderful and there’s a whole new adjustment that happens. And I think that’s really precious. People talk about it’s difficult when your children leave home... of course our children have left home long ago... but for us it’s been wonderful. We’ve had time on our own and we make as much use of it as we can. I think it’s very important to find something when your children leave home, that the two of you do together that is meaningful and nourishing to both of you. When I look around at my family and my friends, that’s often when couples go different ways. Then one feels that you’re living two separate lives. And it’s very difficult to find a place of connection because your priorities have been work, or children, or both. And now none of those are something that you share anymore. I never give advice... I wouldn’t take it anyway. But for us, what’s really helped was having, as Margie says, not only a common direction in our life but a sense that we actually deliberately do things together that are meaningful to us. Every night we gather around sunset and we watch the sun go down. In a sense, ritual in that way was always a part of our life. So we always have watched the sun go down. It was always important for us. And when the children were younger they would join us. And now that they’re not here we sit together and we talk about them all the time. Not all the time darling. But it’s quite a deliberate, ritualised part of the day. So we make it precious, I think that’s what we try and do. And it does become precious. Not so much because we set out to make something precious but we decided how we wanted to spend that time together. And it turned out to be precious, which is wonderful. I feel quite strongly, growing older, that however much I look back to a more romantic postcard version of what life could be that something fantastically, wonderfully ordinary has taken its place. Ordinary is extraordinary. If you think of your life, it’s the little things, the ordinary little things, that are very meaningful and you don’t forget them. Little kindnesses, little actions  that you don’t expect to happen, are the ordinary. And I think one of the most ordinary things that we humans are made to do is to be present and listen to each other. And I think it’s only when we stop that we see the extraordinary in the ordinary, when we really stop and feel and hear. In the same way that the leaves change in spring and fall in autumn and that certain birds appear at certain times of the year and the sun comes and the wind goes... all of that is part of my life. And she is absolutely, intimately as much a part of it as all of that. I live in the veld (nature) and my wife. That’s how it feels. I’m so pleased you live in me. I’d like to think that she feels something of the same. There’s a sense of almost the inevitability of looking around and finding you here next to me in the same way that I lift the blind in the morning  and see the sun come up. That has been a discovery for me that I did not anticipate. And I wish it for everybody. And I think if one gives oneself a chance it will appear all by itself. If I look over one day and she’s not there, it will be heartbreaking. That’s absolutely true. I will then as best I can honour the life that we’ve had together. She is my life and my life will continue. Saying ‘she is my life’ doesn’t mean that I have no life without her. Saying ‘she is my life’ means that when she’s with me, it’s full of her. It means that when she dies and I’m still around that my life will consist of whatever there is around me. And that almost my duty to her would be to live that life as best as I can. As she mentioned, we undertook not to hide behind each other, that I only live through you. I live through you, but that’s just the beginning, it’s not the end. So that when you die I’ll weep, I’ll build you a fantastic grave overlooking the hills, and we’ll have sirens and choirs of angels all over the place. And then I’ll play music with the angels. That’s how it feels to me. And I’m not looking forward to it. It sounds like you are... the choir of angels. Shall I bring them on now? I think the way I would honour her would be to get on with the life that is left for me. That’s what she would wish for me, more than anything. She would want me to see the sun come up, to dig in the garden, to look after visitors, to make the bed properly at last. But I think that she would trust me that however sad it was that sadness would become my life and would be manure for whatever last days are left which are probably not going to be very many. But that would be a huge event for me. I’ve got a little poem that I’d like to recite if I may? I’ll try and remember it. I shaved my head for the children of Palestine. I swept up the leaves in the Jewish cemetery. My wife wrapped presents for the old ladies in the frail care home. My daughter washed the dishes after lunch. The Buddha of Compassion has 84 000 hands. Which of those are yours?",{}

Lyrics

Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
For a moment, there it goes
Turn around, next thing you know
Love is back

Oh, my God, I feel so bored
I'm startin' to realise that all the boys that I find
Are all trouble, I told my mother
She said, ""Girl, get your glass full""
So I did and I saw

You
I saw you gleaming across the scene, across the room
It's all in you
I need the meaning when I see it all in you

Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
For a moment, there it goes
Turn around, next thing you know
Love is back

Hallelujah, it's nice to know you
It's so peculiar how you've come and changed my mind
I'll fall head first, I hope it doesn't hurt
What's your preference? 'Cause I know mine

And it's you
Foolish of me to say these things, but I want to
I know it's all in you
Don't need a reason when I see it all in you

Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
For a moment, there it goes
Turn around, next thing you know
Love is back

Might be foolish or out my mind
Must've said it a thousand times
Can't be lyin' if I see the truth
I know who and I look at you
Might be too young to realise
If there's a mountain, I should've climbed it

But love
Love is back
Love is back
Good thing I know, I know love is back
And I know that love is back
Love is back
Love is back, mm-mm-mm
Love is back, oh, yeah
Love is back
Love is back

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnRBEspHvCw,A Homeless Girl’s Love Made Me Rich | @LoveBusterShow,"Are you afraid of falling in love? 

Christian noticed someone hiding under a table at a restaurant. He peaked beneath the tablecloth to see a girl curled up in there. At this moment, his fiance showed up. She asked him what he was doing, and before he could answer, the mysterious girl kissed him. He pushed her away and got up: “I was looking for this”, Chris said while showing his fiance a gorgeous wedding ring. The woman smiled: “I would say yes if you weren’t hiding a mistress under this table”. She walked away, and Chris was left alone and confused. He turned to the girl and asked: “Why did you do that? She loved me”. The girl was creepily calm: “Then why did she steal your ring?”.
Chris looked inside the velvet box and realized the jewel was indeed gone. 

He rushed after his fiance… and saw her at a pawn shop, selling the ring. Chris was heartbroken. He collapsed on the floor, weakened by the pain. But the mysterious girl showed up once more: “I’m sorry. It’s all my fault. And I’m going to fix it”.

Venus Taurus in this reading we'll be focusing on your new person or your current connection let's see Taurus let's see Sun Moon Rising and Venus Bond selfishness divorce ego O Okay so Taurus um um you are dealing here with someone who has big ego big big ego it feels like you sh very strong bond with this person okay but this is someone here who who's been quite selfish and I feel that at some point ego got better of them and you might feel like something ended between the two of you energetically what the fact that we have this reading about this person it feels like it it it hasn't really you know you might had falling out or there was an argument or disagreement or this person created tension and it's like you are not on the speaking terms at the moment but yeah I feel this person said something they did it was selfish uh and it created some sort of kind of distance between the two of you distance emotional distance at the moment let's see could you please show me more we have King of Swords Six of Pentacles Two of Pentacles Knight of Wands Ace of Pentacles and Justice with the four of Swords the death card and six of cups yeah yeah it's not over Taurus at the moment there might be no contact situation or it's like there's a silence between the two of you that's going to change it yeah it's like it will come to an end because we have the death cut and look what we have the following card here there is this six of Cups re this person wants to reconnect reconcile yeah they want to come back or at least talk about about the situation but for me this is more about um they want reconciliation with you yeah things going to change things going to change we have King of Swords Six of Pentacles Two of Pentacles Ace of Wands Ace of why Ace of Wands Knight of Wands excuse me Ace of Pentacles and Justice yeah this person here will will come forward they feel it's a solid offer okay it's their perspective I feel this person will offer some sort of kind of explanation this person will offer uh to make things right with you or it's like let's bring peace to the situation with the Justice mhm is it a solid offer well it's coming from the Knight of Wands it's coming from a very inconsistent energy I feel this person has been quite in and out hot and cold with you they brought a certain amount of uncertainty and they've been very inconsistent so for some of you might be feeling like well I don't know if this person can be taken seriously therefore if their offer can be taken seriously but they will make a move towards you we have King of Swords Six of Pentacles and two of pentac there is something here Taurus about this person telling you something else and then they changing their mind or it's like changing um the scenario uh let's say it's an example let's say they said something like yeah um last Saturday I went to spend some time with my uh with my grandmother right and then you've asked them let's say next week the other day and they said that they went um to meet up with their friends or something like this you know that's what I am getting it's like change of scenario with the Two of Pentacles Six of Pentacles and the King of Swords and also Taurus what I am getting here that you are dealing with someone who likes to be in control very autocratic kind of energy it's like what I am saying is right and you should just accept this a little bit of an attitude I'm getting here quite a big ego indeed I feel this person has problems to listen it's like they don't listen and I feel that you have a lot to say you might be dealing Taurus with Aquarius we have Libra we have Scorpio let's see could you please show me this person's feelings you might be seeing 1111 a lot for of Wands you might be dealing with your twinflame doesn't have to be the case but for some of you might feel that way about this person let's see could you please show me this person's feelings towards Taurus three of Pentacles wanting to work with you [Music] the devil card two of Swords king of Pentacles stubbor starborn person Taurus Knight of Swords six of Wands and the Seven of [Music] Swords full of Pride six of Wands convinced that they know best Knight of Swords seven of Swords yeah this person has some explaining to do the thing is here Taurus that this person is convinced that you will believe them seven of Swords here suggests that they are very strategic this individual but also it feels like they were they they were hiding something it's like they weren't fully transparent with you and I feel that they got caught by you it's like something didn't make sense it didn't add up we have the devil card two of swords with the king of Pentacles in their feelings I will say it Taurus I feel this person is in denial this is someone who uh feels that you know they are okay everything is fine but the reality is that they need to change the devil card here suggests that they are bringing something toxic on emotional level you know I feel this person can be quite emotionally manipul ctive um I feel that they doing it because it's like they creating some sort of protection for themselves I feel this person is quite guarded with regards to their heart it's like they don't want to get emotionally hurt they don't they don't want their heart to be broken therefore they are protecting their heart here with the two of Swords but I'm seeing someone who is very stubborn and it's very difficult for them to admit that they made a mistake or they are in a wrong [Music] mhm I feel Taurus that this person is actually qu a little bit obsessing over you with this with the devil energy with the devil card excuse me you didn't care with someone who likes to be in control Taurus they do they want to have the last World word and I feel this person actually stuck on you you know with the devil card and two of Swords emotionally that's why we had six of Cups CU they are coming back you might be dealing with Capricorn that's right Capricorn let's see could you please show me this how this person sees this whole situation we have Knight of Cups 10 of Cups Queen of Swords the moon with five of Wands the Tower and the high priestess there is something here about this person knowing that they need to tell you the truth they they need to stop it's like exposure because High Priestess is holding a secret it's unknown the tower it's a destruction of some sort of kind of um Foundation here and five of Wands it's conflict yeah I for some of you there was like a passionate exchange of views and this I feel that you you caught this person of not telling you the full truth and being not fully transparent with you it's like they got exposed for the for their um secrets we have Knight of Cups 10 of Cups Queen of Swords s and the moon well this person here will be very nice Taurus they they're coming for some of you this is someone who um will Express that they want to be with you you know that you are they happy ever after they might even give you a token of affection or gift um Queen of Swords and the moon it's like they want you to heal them out they like to talk but this person um with the moon card I'm not seeing here to be honest with you Taurus them clarifying things with you it's like I don't know they will be Charming it's like this person feels that they can get away with it they feel it's a solid offer you know that they're going to make things right with you but it's coming from this Knight of Wands that over and it's a very in and out hot and cold and kind of unpredictable energy Taurus you might be dealing with Gemini we have Pisces cancerian energy with the moon Scorpio Aries moreon Pisces could you please show me the outcome The Chariot King Of Wands eight of Wands okay seven of Wands that cards wanted to come out okay the temperance judgment And The Fool yeah yeah judgment they want to resurrect rekindle something with you as an overall energy for your reading Taurus Temperance they want to bring more kind of you know Harmony to the situation it's like let's have a quiet conversation that's what I am getting the full they want to start over that's why I was getting here it's not over between the two of you far from it we have the Chariot King Of Wands eight of Wands seven of Wands it's like there is I feel you're dealing here with someone who is a very um they might have a quick temper or it's like they are very passionate with this with all this wands energy but at the same time it's like this person trying to be in control what they saying to you I feel however I feel that at this time they didn't pay attention what they were saying and you caught them there is still something here about this person when it comes to communication with the seven of Wands it's like but I but I haven't done that or it's like they are pushing away some sort of something that is going to be discussed it's like they are not admitting it that's what I am getting here from eight of Wands with the seven of Wands The Chariot suggest here that this person will take action towards you but that communication it's still this person will try to deflect I feel Taurus that's what's going to happen but you will hear from them you will hear from this person you might be dealing with Sagittarius we have more Aquarius Aries uh Scorpio cancerian energy with the Chariot Taurus if I haven't mentioned a person sign of zodiac but you resonate with this message that's your reading crosswatch as the roles can be revers Taurus I will leave it here thank you so so

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5i3QRvPA9Y,Paul Partohap - P.S. I LOVE YOU (Lyric Video),"(VERSE)
The only place I call home, you are
Every hope and dream I've ever had, you are
In other lifetimes, without any doubt
I'll keep choosing you

Like a cool breeze on a summer day, you are
Like a brightest star up in the sky, girl you shine
Keep making me wanting more
Girl, you are what I am lookin' for

(CHORUS)
I love you (love you oh)
I love you in every universe
You'll always be the first
Love you, you're my only one

I love you (I love you)
Love you still, I always will
I want you to know how I feel (how I feel)
And all the promise that I'll fulfill 

(My only one, my only love)

Lyrics:
Dil Ibaadat Kar Raha Hai, Dhadkane Meri Sun
Tujhko Main Kar Lu Haasil Lagi Hai Yahi Dhun
Jindagi Ki Shaak Se Lu Kuchh Hasin Pal Main Chun
Tujhko Main Kar Lu Haasil Lagi Hai Yahi Dhun

Dil Ibaadat Kar Raha Hai, Dhadkane Meri Sun
Tujhko Main Kar Lu Haasil Lagi Hai Yahi Dhun
Jindagi Ki Shaak Se Lu Kuchh Hasin Pal Main Chun
Tujhko Main Kar Lu Haasil Lagi Hai Yahi Dhun

Jo Bhi Jitne Pal Jiu, Unhe Tere Sang Jiu
Jo Bhi Kal Ho Abb Mera Use Tere Sang Jiu
Jo Bhi Saanse Main Bharu Unhe Tere Sang Bharu
Chaahe Jo Ho Raasta Use Tere Sang Chalu
Dil Ibaadat Kar Raha Hai, Dhadkane Meri Sun
Tujhko Main Kar Lu Haasil Lagi Hai Yahi Dhun

Mujhko De Tu Mit Jaane Abb Khud Se Dil Mil Jaane
Kyun Hai Ye Itna Faasala
Lamahe Yeh Phir Na Aane Inko Tu Na De Jaane
Tu Mujhpe Khud Ko De Luta
Tujhe Tujhse Tod Lu Kahi Khud Se Jod Lu
Meri Jismo Jaan Pe Aa Teri Khushbu Odh Lu
Jo Bhi Saanse Main Bharu Unhe Tere Sang Bharu
Chaahe Jo Ho Raasta Use Tere Sang Chalu
Dil Ibaadat Kar Raha Hai Dhadkane Meri Sun
Tujhko Main Kar Lu Haasil Lagi Hai Yahi Dhun

Baaho Me De Bas Jaane Sine Me De Chhup Jaane
Tujh Bin Main Jaau Toh Kaha
Tujhse Hai Mujhko Paane Yaado Ke Woh Najraane
Ik Jinpe Hak Ho Bas Mera
Teri Yaado Me Rahu Tere Khwaabo Me Jagu
Mujhe Dhundhe Jab Koyi Teri Aankho Me Milu
Jo Bhi Saanse Main Bharu Unhe Tere Sang Bharu
Chaahe Jo Ho Raasta Use Tere Sang Chalu
Dil Ibaadat Kar Raha Hai, Dhadkane Meri Sun
Tujhko Main Kar Lu Haasil Lagi Hai Yahi Dhun

Billy Ward is a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) and has been practicing in for the past 13 years in the New York City Suburbs of New Jersey. In addition to having a private practice, he has also been counseling students at Seton Hall Prep High School since 1998.  Currently he is the director of retreats for the school and also teaches a senior course for Human Development and Theology.

Billy is a graduate from Georgetown University where he studied Psychology.  He was also the quarterback of the football team for four years.  He had a short stint with the Baltimore Ravens in 1999, which was a great experience and personal achievement.  He continues to credit his athletic experiences with helping him to understand the mind-body connection and the ability to set a life goal with great determination and tenacity. After leaving Baltimore he continued his study of psychology at Seton Hall University where he attained his Masters Degree and Post Masters Degree.

Reviewer: Ariana Bleau Lugo Here's the deal: Life is really all about love. I'm not just saying that
because I'm a father of a newborn baby; I'm saying that because
as a teacher and as a therapist I've seen people basically
choose between two things: love or something else. What I've witnessed
and experienced is this: When people choose love, they always choose right. I was asked to speak today
on the topic of illumination, and it made me think about the way
the light inside us all can shine. My favorite way is through our love which can illuminate in our relationships. The most important relationship
that we'll ever have, is the relationship
that we have with ourselves. And next comes the relationships
that we share with one another. As simply as I can put it, we are here, on this very Earth,
to love and to be loved - and love is light. In a second, what I'd like 
to do with you today, is a brief, relaxing, 
guided-imagery exercise, where I'm going to have you
close your eyes and consider three expressions of light
that can return us to love. I'm going to have you close your eyes
and consider three items, and then associate each item
with a person in your life. So, let's get ready. Can I ask you to put
your feet flat on the floor, palms facing up in your lap, and when you're ready, gently allow your upper eyelids
to meet your lower eyelashes. Close your eyes 
and let's everyone take a deep breath. Relax your shoulders. The first item I'd like you
to picture is the sun. Picture the sun in the big, blue sky,
feel the warmth of her rays, and consider how the sun
continues to show up every day, sharing its light and energy
unconditionally, even on a cold February morning. Is there somebody in your life
that reminds you of the sun? Somebody that loves you unconditionally? Picture that person now
and feel their love. The next item I'd like you
to picture is a lighthouse. See the light emanating
from the top of the structure at the ocean's edge
where the sea meets the land, and remember its primary purpose: To help guide sailors and boaters home. Is there somebody in your life
that helps guide you home? To your authentic self? To the truth of who you are? To the person that you're meant to be? To the path that you're meant to be on? Picture that person now and consider the direction
that they're encouraging you to head in. The last item I'd like you
to picture is a disco ball. See the light bouncing off of it, think of the energy in the room
where you might find this unique object, maybe you hear
your favorite song playing. Is there somebody in your life
that reminds you of a disco ball? Somebody that shows up
with the fun, loving energy wherever they are, wherever they go? Picture that person now and consider how they are encouraging
you to live and love. Gently float open your eyes. Today I'd like to share a story with you
about a student of mine. His name was Daniel. I met Daniel the very first year
I was a classroom teacher. I had no experience as a theology teacher
in an all-boys prep school, and somehow this little guy,
this 103-pound wrestler, he became more of a teacher to me
than a student, because he showed me
and everybody in the school building how to shine their love and their light by being an example of how it's done. You see, the same year 
that I met this little guy was the same year
that I was cut from the NFL. Felt like a little bit of my light
had been taken from me when the Baltimore Ravens told me
I can no longer be their quarterback. I had trained with them all summer,
I felt like a kid in Disney, I was playing and competing
with some of my childhood heroes in stadiums
that I had only visited as a fan. Playing in the NFL
was an incredible experience, but at the end of the summer, a week before our first game,
on the last day of cuts, I was released. I had to return home to New Jersey 
to figure out a new career. I had graduated
from Georgetown University with the degree in psychology,
so I guessed I could teach that, but I was hired
at an all-boys prep school to coach football and teach theology. It was kind of like a life course
for the incoming freshmen. Gave me the opportunity to teach the guys the importance of being kind,
caring and thoughtful. It really healed my broken heart. I loved teaching 
as much as I loved playing football. And that's where I met Daniel. He came into my classroom
like a little disco ball. He had an energy and a light about him
that everybody wanted to be around. Daniel connected
with everybody in the school. I used to love watching him
walk the hallways. His smile was reflected back to him
in every corner. Athletes, band guys,
cool guys, smart guys, teachers and coaches, all felt the love of this pint-sized,
103-pound wrestler. People loved Daniel because he was free. He was free to be himself, and most of us know
how difficult that can be. I remember when Daniel
found out it was my birthday during his freshman year. He took it upon himself to create
a homemade birthday card for me. He even taped a Starburst candy
and a pack of Wrigley's gum to the inside. He presented it to me
in front of the class. Daniel was redefining cool, and he made it cool
to be thoughtful, caring and kind, and his classmates loved him for it. It was in this way
that our brotherly bond began. And it was during his sophomore year that Daniel started to campaign
for me to date his older cousin Lia, so that we could officially be family. (Laughter) He even brought her
to a wrestling match one weekend. I was only there
with about one other person, and Daniel had about 15 relatives
cheering him on that night. It was a beautiful night. Then Daniel came into school
the following Monday, and he was mad. He said, ""Mr. Ward, you brought
your girlfriend to my wrestling match, when I brought my cousin
to introduce you?"" (Laughter) I said, ""Wow, Daniel, hold on a second! That girl happens to be my younger sister, (Laughter) and, second of all, I didn't know you were trying
to play matchmaker that night."" It felt like a real compliment
to my teachings. My message of love and be loved
was really making an impact. For years, I've been practicing shouting commands
for the NFL football field, but I had been practicing
another message all along. I was never the type of football player
that was overly aggressive or tough. I never yelled at my teammates, and I never yell
at my students in the classroom. Some people say this may make
people walk all over you, but I believe otherwise. An older teacher once told me,
when I first began teaching, that I shouldn't smile in the classroom
until after a few months have gone by. (Laughter) I guess the theory is that the students
would think I was tough, but I love to smile, and I have a different theory. I believe that 
the toughest guy in the room is not the football guy; it's the loving guy. It's the most manly thing
that can ever be accomplished. It's not that difficult to do, but it requires great thought and courage. I loved football because I thought
it was one of the finest team sports. When we're on the field, playing together, relating as teammates, defending each other,
protecting each other, doing a little dance in the end zone
to celebrate the points we score - Football was really about relationships. And so is love. Love is a team sport. A team that we are all a part of. And on this team, Daniel is an all-star. But Daniel never had
the glory of an end zone dance, or even a dance at his junior prom. And that's because his life
extinguished way too early. One night, during Daniel's junior year, in February, he was rolling up the mats
with his wrestling buddies, and he collapsed in pain. Daniel suffered an aortic aneurysm, and he died
early the next morning in hospital. It was tragic. The date was February 7th, 2002. Exactly 12 years ago today. I don't think it's any coincidence
that I'm here today with the opportunity to share Daniel's story with you. Daniel is my lighthouse. When the water is dark and dangerous, the lighthouse can provide
a warm and inviting light, almost as if to say, this way home. Daniel brought me home
literally by bringing me to his home. The night after he died,
I visited his family, along with the number 
of other teachers from our school. We were all greeted
by Daniel's cousin Lia, who thanked us for being there
during such a devastating time. I introduced myself
as Daniel's theology teacher, and she replied, ""Oh, you're the one
that Daniel wanted me to marry!"" (Laughter) It was kind of like a light went on. I ended up sitting with Lia and her mom, sharing stories of Daniel
and looking at pictures. It was a really difficult time
for us both, but it hard for me not to notice that Lia had the same passion
and energy for life that I saw in Daniel. I wish he could have seen us meet. Riding home that night, I quietly recalled
my last moment with Daniel. He was visiting my class. And like many times before, Daniel would just stroll right in. And because I was sitting behind the desk,
he came over to me, and we're about the same height, and our shoulders bumped
into each other as we talked. I introduced him to the class as the 103-pound wrestler
who was having a great season, and the younger guys
just looked at him in awe. Here was this guy,
smaller than most of them, but he carried so much weight
and loving energy. On his way out 
of the classroom that morning, Daniel turned over his shoulder
in his cool little way and said, ""See you around, Mr. Ward."" Daniel died early the next morning. Couple of weeks later,
I thought I saw Daniel at school. The student was sitting
with [his] back to me, and it looked like Daniel. And for a moment
I believed that it was him. But soon the student stood,
and it obviously wasn't Daniel. But to me the message was clear. The same love and light that I witnessed 
and experienced in Daniel, could be found in everyone and everything. So I began to look for Daniel, to look for love
in everyone and everything, and at the crucial point in my life,
even in myself. Daniel was right when he said,
""See you around."" Because the same love in him
is within us all. Just as I tell my students back at school, there is so much goodness in you, and you are all, each and everyone of you, worthy of love and belonging, just as you are, imperfectly perfect. And once you begin open yourself to love, you will learn to see it everywhere, creating a peace, a freedom and a truth that will shift your overall,
entire experience. Think about it. If I stand right here
and I shift just a little bit, my view changes entirely. The same is true for love. If we can begin to make an effort to love and be loved
without any conditions, we will bring a whole new level of meaning to our relationships
and to our experience. I'm going to ask you
to close your eyes one more time. Picture the sun. Author Anthony de Mello writes: ""Has the Sun ever said
to the Earth: you owe me. Look what happens to a love like that.
It lights up the whole sky."" Is there somebody in your life
that can use a little unconditional love? Picture that person now. Remember the lighthouse. Remember its primary purpose:
To help guide sailors and boaters home. Is there somebody in your life
that can use a little guidance, a little direction? Picture that person now. And, lastly, picture the disco ball. Daniel was free to be himself because he loved himself unconditionally. We could all reflect 
a little bit of love back home, so that we can dance
like nobody is watching. Is there something in your life
that you've been waiting to do? Gently float open your eyes and smile. Twelve years ago, after Daniel died, I decided to ask his cousin Lia out
for dinner in his honor. We had so much to talk about, and I'm happy to tell you that,
four years after that, I asked Lia to marry me. She continues
to light up my life every day, Lia is my sunshine,
and now we have two sons. Our oldest is almost three,
and his name is John Daniel, whom we affectionately call J.D., and he's our little disco ball. We also have another son,
who is just 12 weeks old now. His name is Casey Christian,
and he's our little lighthouse. When people ask Lia if the boys will play football in the NFL
someday like their daddy did, she says, ""Maybe."" But our only wish for them
is to truly live a life where they can love and be loved. Thank you very much. (Applause)",{}

Old Love
yuji ft putri dahlia

when you were here
the stars disappear 
nothing can outshined the dress that you wear

we should be dancing
cause girl you look stunning 
Let’s spend the night together till reach the morning

I want to hold your hand and show what is love
when you’re smiling
and when you’re laughing 
we should keep dancing to treasure the feelings

like its the old love
(its the love love)
this is the way that we both wanna feel
under the moonlight we made our first kiss
cause this is the moment that you made me feel
like its the old love
(its the old love)
come on and hold me i want you right here
stay close to me so you dont feel the fear
i’ll never let go cause im just right here

when im with you
feels like deja vu
i realized that dreams really comethru
we keep on talking
for the moment we live in
let’s just keep drinking till moon disappear 

you are the one
the one that i want
the one that will stay by my side till im gone
the love of my live
and i’ll sacrifice 
just for the moment we last long forever

like its the old love
(its the old love)
this is the way that we both wanna feel
under the moonlight we made our first kiss
cause this is the moment that you made me feel
like its the old love
come on and hold me i want you right here

Lyrics:
I love you... I love you, I love you
Baby I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation and connection to the sun
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you and God who's my sunlight I'm blooming, grown so beautifully
Baby I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and misty world
I am in love with you (in love)
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (in love)
I'll never leave
Just keep loving me the way I love you loving me
I am in love with you (in love)
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (in love)
I'll never leave
Just keep loving me the way I love you loving me
And I know you love me, love me for who I am
Cause years before I became who I am, baby you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife and I see my whole future in your eyes
The thought of all my love for you, sometimes makes me wanna cry
Realize all of my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side
I am in love with you (in love)
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (in love)
I'll never leave
Just keep loving me the way I love you loving me
Every time I see your face, my heart smiles
Every time it feels so good, it hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love, to hold, to feel, to breathe
To live you
Dangerously in love, yeah
I am in love with you (in love)
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (in love)
I'll never leave
Just keep loving me the way I love you loving me
Dangerously (dangerously)
Dangerous, dangerously in love with you
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you.. oh yes..

Lyrics 

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring

And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up

Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken, one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words they always win, but I know I'll lose

And I'd sing a song, that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up

Oh oh
I wanna sing a song, that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love

Lyrics: 
Reckless Love
Written by Cory Asbury, Caleb Culver, and Ran Jackson

Verse 1

Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me

Chorus

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights ‘til I’m found, leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn’t earn it, I don’t deserve it, still You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

Verse 2

When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me
When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
You have been so, so kind to me

Bridge

There’s no shadow You won’t light up
Mountain You won’t climb up
Coming after me
There’s no wall You won’t kick down
Lie You won’t tear down
Coming after me",Bethel Music,"reckless love cory asbury,reckless love of god,reckless love bethel,cory asbury reckless love,reckless love live,Reckless Love,reckless love,wreckless love,bethel

the 99 to find the one every time so before i spoke a word [Music] before i spoke away you were singing over me and you have been so so good to me yes yes yes yes [Music] for i took a breath you breathe your life in me and you have been so so kind come on every voice lift it over [Music] leaves the 99 [Music] never reckless [Music] [Music] still your love [Music] when i felt no words you prayed it all for me yeah you did and you have been so so kind to me [Music] is oh god [Music] there's no shadow you won't light up mountain you won't climb up coming after me [Applause] there's no bar you won't kick down lie you won't tear down coming after there's no shadow there's no shadow you won't light a mountain you won't climb up coming after me there's no wall you won't get down [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] coming oh [Applause] is no [Music] yeah yeah i want to read this scripture to us is that a luke 15. sometimes people get confused by it but i feel like the lord's all over it tonight i want to read it to us [Music] wow [Music] it says now the text collectors and sinners are all gathering around to hear jesus the pharisees and teachers of the law of muttered this man welcomes the sinners and eats with them the religious people are mad it sets the stage and jesus pipes up he told them this parable says suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them doesn't he leave the 99 in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it and after he finds it he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and he goes home he calls his friends he calls his neighbors together and says rejoice with me because i found my lost sheep and i tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous people who don't [Music] man he's that good i want to just read a couple thoughts just share a little bit of the story behind this song and we'll sing that bridge one more time and we'll go nuts we'll see what happens so when i use the the phrase the reckless love of god when we say it we're not saying that god himself is reckless he's not crazy we are however saying that the way he loves is in many regards quite so what i mean is this he's utterly unconcerned with the consequences of his actions with regard to his own safety comfort and well-being his love isn't crafty or slick it's not cunning or shrewd in fact all things considered it's quite shock-like and might i even suggest sometimes downright ridiculous his love bankrupted heaven for you for me his love doesn't consider himself first it isn't selfish or self-serving he doesn't wonder what he'll gain or lose by putting himself on the line he simply puts himself out there on the off chance that you and i might look back at him and give him that love in return his love leaves the 99 to find the one every time and to many practical adults that's a foolish concept but what if he loses the 99 and finding the one right what if finding that one lost sheep is and will always be supremely important his love isn't cautious it's a love that sent his own son to die a gruesome death on a cross there's no plan b with the love of god he gives his heart so completely so preposterously that if refused we would think it irreparably broken yet he gives himself away again and again and again and again time and time again make no mistake our sins do pain as hard and 70 times seven is a lot of times to get your heart broken and yet he opens up and allows us back in every single time his love saw you when you hated him and all logic said they'll reject me he said i don't care what it costs me i lay my life on the line as long as i get their hearts to make it personal is love saw me a broken down kid with regret as deep as the ocean my innocence and youth poured out like water [Music] and he found me and he put me on his shoulders and he carried me on because he's just that good he's just that kind he's a father that never gives up so as we sing this bridge in chorus one more time just let it let it break down those walls tonight [Music] there's no shadow there's no shadow you won't light up mountain you won't climb up coming after me there's no wall you won't kick down lie you won't tear down coming after me yeah again there's no shadow you won't light up bouncing your own climber coming out he's breaking off self-hatred tonight there's no wall you won't kick down lie you won't stay down coming out there's no shadow now there's no shadow you won't light up bouncing you want come on let it rise there's no wall you won't kick down how you want come on declare it no shadow now there's no shadow [Applause] [Music] one more time love of god breakfast [Applause]

But as historian Douglas Brinkley points out, Dylan's love of movies has been a recurring theme in his art, and his persona, all his life.

crooked highs a new movie about Bob Dylan   starring Timothee Chalamet arrives in theaters 
Christmas day as historian Douglas Brinkley tells   us it's just the latest chapter in a lengthy 
love affair between Dylan and the movies growing up in the iron rich mining town of Hibbing 
Minnesota in the 1940s and '50s Bob Dylan was   not exposed to much non-conformity or social 
upheaval except that is at the movies [Music] rain it was at the local theaters one of which was 
owned by his relatives [Music] that he first set   eyes on Brigitte Bardot an early crush and Muse 
for some of his first songs he said my friend   Bob what do we need to make the country grow I 
said my friend John Brigitte Bardot I tried to   miss them and then he hit young Bob sported 
a leather jacket after seeing Marlon Brando   in the wild one you the big cop in the town when 
he saw the juvenile melodrama Blackboard Jungle   with its innovative rock 'n' roll soundtrack 
he reportedly said to a friend this is exactly   what we've been trying to tell people about 
ourselves there were other people why should   you be the only one involved but I am involved 
we are all involved seeing James Dean in Rebel   Without a Cause inspired him to stand up against 
the shackles of Cold War conformity in his music   of mothers and fathers throughout the land and 
all criticize what you can't understand once Dylan   made it to New York's greenage Village it was 
the art house International films that caught his eye Truffaut's shoot the piano player Fellini's 
La dolce vita that film about a tabloid journalist   searching in vain for fulfillment in a hedonistic 
Rome looked Dylan later said like life in a   Carnival mirror she looked like she stepped out 
[Music] of Dylan's first major film appearance   was a cameo in director Sam Peckinpah's 
Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid who are you   that's a good question the film spawned the 
classic song knockin' on Heaven's Door now   the Nobel laureate's most stream song knock 
knock knock on [Music] heaven's knock knock   knock his music has enhanced scores 
of movie scores from the big [Music] Lebowski to more recently St 
Vincent she said I'll give you shter one film stuck with Dylan for decades the older 
you grow the more you learn son now turn around   and head for the door well there was this movie 
I seen one time about a man riding across the   desert and it's starred Gregory Peck When Peck 
heard his name on Dylan's epic 1986 ballad   Brownsville girl he phoned him up to thank him 
Peck would reiterate his gratitude in 1997 when   he presented Dylan with the Kennedy Center Honor 
thank you Mr Dylan for rocking the country and the ages the new biopic a complete 
unknown starring an astounding   Timothee Chalamet is hardly the 
first cinematic depiction of Dylan but it's a reminder of 
the enduring and symbiotic   relationship between Dylan and the [Music] movies and a welcome excuse to revisit the 
work of this singular American Artist [Music]",{}

🎤 Lyrics: Tom Odell - Another Love

[Verse 1]
I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel all right
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

[Verse 2]
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hands been broken once, too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

[Bridge]
(Oh, need a love, now, my heart is thinking of)
I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

Lyrics:

I must be crazy now
Maybe I dream too much
But when I think of you
I long to feel your touch

To whisper in your ear
Words that are old as time
Words only you would hear
If only you were mine
I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do
And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side

I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

So today, I finally find the courage deep inside
Just to walk right up to your door
But my body can't move when I finally get to it
Just like a thousand times before
Then without a word he handed me this letter
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said

I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

Well maybe I, I need a little love yeah
And maybe I, I need a little care
And maybe I, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you
Oh you need somebody just to hold you
If you do, just reach out and I'll be there

I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

These three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Oh, I love you
Please say you love me too
Please please
Say you love me too
Till the end of time
My baby
Together, together, forever
Till the end of time
I love you
I will be your light
Shining bright
Shining through your eyes
My baby

Lyrics:
It must have been love
But it's over now

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love
But it's over now
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow
It must have been love
But it's over now
From the moment we touched
'Til the time had run out

Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I've turned to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love (must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now)
It was all that I wanted
Now I'm living without
It must have been love (it must have been love)
But it's over now

It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

It must have been love (must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now)
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow
It must have been love (must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now)
From the moment we touched
'Til the time had run out

Yeah, it must have been love (must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now)
It was all that I wanted
Now I'm living without
It must have been love
But it's over now

It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

Oh-oh (must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now), now
It must have been love (it must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now), now",Roxette,"Roxette,it must have been love,roxette it must have been love,it must have been love lyrics,roxette lyrics,roxette it must have been love live,it must have been love music video,80s soft rock,80s soft rock hits,90s soft rock hits,roxette greatest hits,roxette best songs,roxette 1990,pretty woman roxette,it must have been love pretty woman,pretty woman soundtrack",10,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music",2009-03-04T14:16:13Z,0:04:16,843373306,106603,True,[Music] day [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music],{}

Lyrics:

I know just how to whisper,
and I know just how to cry;
I know just where to find the answers;
and I know just how to lie.
I know just how to fake it,
and I know just how to scheme;
I know just when to face the truth,
and then I know just when to dream.
And I know just where to touch you,
and I know just what to prove;
I know when to pull you closer,
and I know when to let you loose.
And I know the night is fading,
and I know that time's gonna fly;
and I'm never gonna tell you everything
I've got to tell you,
but I know I've got to give it a try.
And I know the roads to riches,
and I know the ways to fame;
I know all the rules
and then I know how to break 'em
and I always know the name of the game.",AirSupplyVEVO,"AirSupplyvevo,vevo,official,video,music video,single,album,Making Love Out of Nothing At All,classic,Air Supply,Arista,Pop",10,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music",2011-03-23T10:34:26Z,0:04:53,393027257,50206,True,"(""Making Love Out Of Nothing At All"") ♪ I know just how to whisper ♪ ♪ And I know just how to cry ♪ ♪ I know just where to find the answers ♪ ♪ And I know just how to lie ♪ ♪ I know just how to fake it ♪ ♪ And I know just how to scheme ♪ ♪ I know just when to face the truth ♪ ♪ And then I know just when to dream ♪ ♪ And I know just where to touch you ♪ ♪ And I know just what to prove ♪ ♪ I know when to pull you closer ♪ ♪ And I know when to let you loose ♪ ♪ And I know the night is fading ♪ ♪ And I know the time's gonna fly ♪ ♪ And I'm never gonna tell you ♪ ♪ Everything I've gotta tell you ♪ ♪ But I know I've gotta give it a try ♪ ♪ And I know the roads to riches ♪ ♪ And I know the ways to fame ♪ ♪ I know all the rules and

[Verse]
I used to think that I wasn't fine enough
And I used to think that I wasn't wild enough
But I won't waste my time tryin' to figure out
Why you playing games—what's this all about?
And I can't believe you're hurting me
I met your girl, what a difference
What you see in her you ain't seen in me
But I guess it was all just make believe

[Chorus]
Oh love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found, found you

[Bridge]
Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
So empty, my heart, my soul, can't go on
Go on without you
My rainy days fade away
When you come around, please tell me, baby
Why you go so far away, why you go...

[Chorus]
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found, I found you

[Bridge]
(Ooh, what I know) I found you (Ooh)
Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
So empty, my heart, my soul, can't go on
Go on, baby, without you
My rainy days fade away
When you come around, say you're here to stay
With me, boy, I don't want you to leave me
I... I need you

[Chorus]
Love, never knew what I was missin' (I never knew)
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin' (I never never)
But I knew once we start kissin', I found, I found...
(We start kissin, I found, I found)
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found...

Lyrics:
Say you love me to my face
I need it more than your embrace
Just say you want me, that's all it takes
Heart's getting torn from your mistakes
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
And babe, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floating away
Just say you love me, just for today
And don't give me time 'cause that's not the same
Want to feel burning flames when you say my name
Want to feel passion flow into my bones
Like blood through my veins
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
And babe, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floating away
Won't you stay
Won't you stay
Slowly, slowly you run for me
But do you know me at all
Someone told me love controls everything
But only if you know
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
(No-no-no-no, no-no)
If you don't wanna try
(Could you try sometime?)
'Cause all that I've been thinking of
(I just think)
Is maybe that you might
(You might)
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
And babe, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floating away

🎤 Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I can't be your love
Look, it’s too trivial for you now
Oh, my life is fallin' apart
Maybe no one will notice if I disappear

[Chorus]
But I'll pray for you all the time
If I could be by your side
I’ll give you all my life, my seasons

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I can't be your love
'Cause I'm afraid I'll ruin your life
While the leaves withered away
And grew again
You have gone far away
I'll be pushing up daisies
And bring all the chances to here

[Chorus]
But I'll pray for you all the time
If I could be by your side
I'll give you all my life, my seasons
By your side, I’ll be your sеasons

[Outro]
My love

Lyrics:

Patta Anaaron Ka Patta Chinaron Ka Jaise Hawaon Mein
Aise Bhatakta Hoon Din Raat Dikhta Hoon Main Teri Raahon Mein
Mere Gunaho Mein Mere Sawabo Mein Shamil Tu
Bhooli Atthanni Si Bachpan Ke Kurte Mein Se Mil Tu

Rakhoon Chhupa Ke Main Sab Se Woh Laila
Maangoon Zamane Se Rab Se Woh Laila
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila 

Teri Talab Thi Haan Teri Talab Hai
Tu Hi Toh Sab Thi Haan Tu Hi Toh Sab Hai
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila

O Meri Laila Laila Khwaab Tu Hai Pehla 
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila (X2)

Maangi Thi Duwaen Jo Unka Hi Asar Hai Hum Sath Hain
Na Yahan Dikhawa Hai Na Yahan Dunyavi Jazbaat Hain

Yahan Pe Bhi Tu Hooron Se Zyada Haseen 
Yaani Dono Jahanon Mein Tumsa Nahi
Jeet Li Hain Aakhir Mein Hum Dono Ne Yeh Baaziyan 

Rakhoon Chhupa Ke Main Sab Se Woh Laila
Maangoon Zamane Se Rab Se Woh Lailan
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila 

Teri Talab Thi Haan Teri Talab Hai
Tu Hi Toh Sab Thi Haan Tu Hi Toh Sab Hai
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila

O Meri Laila Laila Khwaab Tu Hai Pehla 
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila (X2)

Zaiqa Jawani Mein, Khwaabon Mein Yaar Ki Mehmaani Mein
Marziyaan Tumhari Hon, Khush Rahoon Main Teri Manmaani Mein

Band Aakhein Karoon Din Ko Raatein Karoon
Teri Zulfon Ko Sehla Ke Baatein Karoon
Ishq Mein Un Baaton Se Hon Meethi Si Naraaziyan

Rakhoon Chhupa Ke Main Sab Se Woh Laila
Maangoon Zamane Se Rab Se Woh Lailan
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila 

Teri Talab Thi Haan Teri Talab Hai
Tu Hi Toh Sab Thi Haan Tu Hi Toh Sab Hai
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila

O Meri Laila Laila Khwaab Tu Hai Pehla 
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila (X2)

Lyrics :- 
Tum mile toh mil gaya yeh jahaan
Tum mile toh har pal hai naya
Tum mile toh sabse hai… faasla
Tum mile toh jaadu chaa gaya
Tum mile toh jeena aa gaya
Tum mile toh maine paaya… hai khuda

Come around… it’s time to baby
Come around..
Come on now… come around…
It’s time to baby… come around
Come around… come around

Palken moondein chaahat meri so rahi thi
Khushboo hawaaon mein thi
Maine nahin mehsoos ki
Mmm mm.mm
Jaane kahaan bahaaren meri khil rahi thi
Khushboo hawaaon mein thi
Maine nahin mehsoos ki

Tum mile toh mehki baarishen
Tum mile toh jaagi khwaahishen
Tum mile toh rangon ka hai silsila
Tum mile toh jaadu chaa gaya
Tum mile toh jeena aa gaya
Tum mile toh maine paaya hai khuda

Ta ra ra.. ta ra ri re… ta ra ra

Tune duaaein suni
Dil ki sadaiyen suni
Tujhse main maangu aur kya
Tujh bin adhura hun main
Tere sang poora hun main
Karta hun tera shukriya

Kaise kahoon, kaise kahoon…
Kaise kahoon…kaise kahoon…
Kaise kahoon lamhe mujhe choo rahe hain
Aisa laga hain inmein tera hi toh ehsaas hai
Ohh hooo
Kaise kahoon dil mein nayi aahaten hain
Aisa laga hain inmein tera hi toh ehsaas hai

Tum mile toh mera dil gaya
Tum mile toh sab kuch mil gaya
Tum mile toh logon se kya vaasta
Tum mile toh jaadu chaa gaya
Tum mile toh jeena aa gaya
Tum mile toh maine paaya hai khuda

Come around… it’s time to baby
Come around..
Come on now… come around…
It’s time to baby… come around
Come around… come around
Come around

Lyrics: 
I was all but 22
I think at the time
I’d been out on the road
Lonely at night
It’d been a while
So it was on my mind
Well I saw him walk in
With his cowboy hat
And I thought to myself
I could use some of that
His boots like glass on a saw dust floor
Had moves like nothin’ I’d ever seen before
So I walked right up
I pulled him to the side
I handed him a beer and looked him right in the eye
And I said “Baby, I think you’re gonna wanna hear this”
I said

Excuse me,
You look like you love me
You look like you want me
To want you to come on home
And baby I don’t blame you
For lookin’ me up and down across this room
I’m drunk and I’m ready to leave
And you look like you love me

Well I was down at the local beer joint with a few of the guys 
When this cute little country girl caught my eye 
And boy let me tell you she was the prettiest thing i’d ever seen in a pair of boots
Well she walked right up to me, handed me a beer 
Gave me a look like, lets get outta here 
And that's when I realized that she was every cowboys dream come true 
She told me this right here, she said..

Excuse me,
You look like you love me
You look like you want me
To want you to come on home
And baby I don’t blame you
For lookin’ me up and down across this room
I’m drunk and I’m ready to leave
And you look like you love me
So if you ever see a man in a cowboy hat

And you think to yourself
I could use some of that
Don’t waste your time
Just give ‘em this here line
Goes a little like this
Excuse me,
You look like you love me
You look like you want me
To want you to come on home
And baby I don’t blame you
For lookin’ me up and down across this room
I’m drunk and I’m ready to leave
And you look like you love me
I’m drunk and I’m ready to leave
And you look like you love me

Lyrics
An empty street, an empty house
A hole inside my heart
I'm all alone, the rooms are getting smaller.

I wonder how, I wonder why,
I wonder where they are
The days we had, the songs we sang together, oh, yeah.

And all my love, I'm holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far

So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue to see you once again, my love.
Over seas from coast to coast
To find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green to see you once again, my love.""",westlifeVEVO,"Westlife,Westlifevevo,vevo,official,video,music video,Westlife My Love Lyrics,single,album,My Love,Coast to Coast,pop,If Let You Go,You Raise Me Up,Fool Again,westlife,Flying without wings,my love,world of our own,What About Now,Uptown Girl,Westlife My Love,Westlife remix,westlife My Love official video,westlife album,westlife full album,westlife essentials,westlife full,westlife official audio",10,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music",2009-10-03T19:49:10Z,0:04:14,374608751,92694,True,"(plane roaring) - Freakin' lads.

🎤Lyrics: Keyshia Cole - Love

I used to think that I wasn't fine enough
And I used to think that I wasn't wild enough
But I won't waste my time tryin' to figure out
Why you playing games—what's this all about?
And I can't believe you're hurting me
I met your girl, what a difference
What you see in her you ain't seen in me
But I guess it was all just make believe


Oh love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found, found you


Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?

Go on without you
My rainy days fade away
When you come around, please tell me, baby
Why you go so far away, why you go...


Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found, I found you


(Ooh, what I know) I found you (Ooh)
Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
So empty, my heart, my soul, can't go on
Go on, baby, without you
My rainy days fade away
When you come around, say you're here to stay
With me, boy, I don't want you to leave me
I... I need you


Love, never knew what I was missin' (I never knew)
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin' (I never never)
But I knew once we start kissin', I found, I found...
(We start kissin, I found, I found)
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found...

사람 사이 사람
바람 사이 바람
각자의 염원이 바래고
덧칠되어

발이 닿을 만큼 굳어지면
비로소 내 세상이 되어줘

나의 작은 마음도
그 안에 자란 나음도
부서지고 굳어지고
녹아내리고나면
그제서야 보이는 나의 영원

사람 사이 사랑
모두 함께 모여서
영원을 바라고
몸 마음 묻어내면

비로소 우리의 세상이 완벽해
사랑으로
사랑으로

나의 작은 마음도
그 안에 작은 파도처럼
부서지고 밀려와선
네게 녹아내리고
그제서야 보이는 나의 영원

Lyrics:
There you were 
You’re gonna make a scene
comparing yourself to the person you were at age 17
I put my suit on 
and I tied my tie
I look like someone I don't recognize 

And it would be so much easier to love you 
If you could only see yourself like me
And wouldn't it hurt much less when you were lonely
If you could only see yourself like me?

I found a letter:
“Dear future me,
I promise I’ll take care of the person we’ll both be eventually
I’ll pick up painting, 
Oh! Oh – and I'll join the gym
I can't shake the feeling that I'll be happy by the time I'm him

And it would be so much easier to love you 
If you could only see yourself like me
And wouldn't it hurt much less when you were lonely
If you could only see yourself like me?

Please be disappointed in me
Isn’t it obvious I wasn't who you think?
And it would be ..

So much easier to love you if you could only see yourself like me
And wouldn’t it hurt much less when you were lonely
If you could only see yourself like me?

LYRICS:
Im just so fucking depressed

In my dreams is where I can find you
Remember, it was just us two. 
Even in my dreams, I made you see, 

In my nights of pain, 
you're just a memory.

You’re just another fucking memory

A kiss so fucking poisonous 
A lie so obvious, it's ruinous.
Now a number, a memory to hide, 
Locked away deep, in the back of my mind.

Let our love burn

How could someone so wonderful, so beautiful, so utterly free, 
Become so worthless to me?
Would you come and let our fucking love burn?

-
Love burn, love burn
Would you come and let our fucking love burn?
Love burn
Would you come and let our fucking love burn?

Our love is burning
and I don’t feel alright
Our love is burning
now break me down
-

Your ignorance, death of our love, so unfair, 
We found the feeling, lost in your empty stare.

And as we look out, we see us burn, i fell in love with you
And when the sun sets, you'll never return.

Tell me, Do you still think of me, huh?
during your silent nights?
'Cause you’re on my mind, when things are not right.
Would you now please come now and let our…

-
Love burn, love burn
Would you come and let our fucking love burn?
Love burn, love burn
Would you come and let our fucking love burn?

Our love is burning
I don’t feel right
Our love is burning
Now break me down
-

Oh break me down
break me down

My baby please break me down",PALEFACE SWISS,,10,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music",2024-12-04T23:01:06Z,0:04:28,162500,760,True,[Applause] [Music] [Applause] I'm just so far get that everybody can't remember it was me my dream I made you my [ __ ] that is so [ __ ] poisonous like so warious is ruinous now a number and high look away okay soone so wonderful so beautiful so want free because so what you [ __ ] what you [ __ ] love [ __ ] oh all love is burning and I don't feel all right all love is burning not rning back down with L and as we look out we see us SP I'm better love with you and when the [Music] sh tell me think of me huh your s night my with you my L [ __ ] want your come and let [ __ ] I don't feel right down [Music] [Music] oh please me oh greate [Music] [Applause] [Music],{}

🎤 Lyrics: Tom Odell - Another Love

[Verse 1]
I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel all right
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

[Verse 2]
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hands been broken once, too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

[Bridge]
(Oh, need a love, now, my heart is thinking of)
I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

🎤 Lyrics: Céline Dion - I Love You

[Intro]
I must be crazy now
Maybe I dream too much
But when I think of you
I long to feel your touch

[Verse 1]
To whisper in your ear
Words that are old as time
Words only you would hear
If only you were mine
I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do
And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side

[Chorus]
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

[Verse 2]
So today, I finally find the courage deep inside
Just to walk right up to your door
But my body can't move when I finally get to it
Just like a thousand times before
Then without a word he handed me this letter
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said

[Chorus]
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

[Verse 3]
Well maybe I, I need a little love yeah
And maybe I, I need a little care
And maybe I, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you
Oh you need somebody just to hold you
If you do, just reach out and I'll be there

[Chorus]
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

[Outro]
These three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Oh, I love you
Please say you love me too
Please please
Say you love me too
Till the end of time
My baby
Together, together, forever
Till the end of time
I love you
I will be your light
Shining bright
Shining through your eyes
My baby

About Ed Sheeran: 
Ed Sheeran may be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: an internationally acclaimed, multi-award winning singer/songwriter who seems to acknowledge no boundaries between styles or eras with elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock woven throughout his music.

Lyrics:

Tell me something, I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain
And if in the moment I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you'll know this
Is something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it
'Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta gotta gotta gotta got to love me harder
And if you really need me, you gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta got to love me harder
(Gotta love me harder)
Love me, love me, love me
Harder, harder, harder
I know your motives and you know mine
The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take away the pain
And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I'll make it feel like the first time
'Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta gotta gotta gotta got to love me harder
(Imma love you harder)
And if you really need me, you gotta gotta gotta gotta got to love me harder
(Love me harder)
Love me, love me, love me
Harder, harder, harder
Love me, love me, love me
Harder, harder, harder
So what do I do if I can't figure it out?
You got to try, try, try again
So what do I do if I can't figure it out?
I'm gonna leave, leave, again
'Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta gotta gotta gotta got to love me harder
(I'll love you, love you, love you)
And if you really need me, you gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta got to love me harder
(Love me, love me, baby)
'Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta gotta gotta gotta got to love me harder
(Love me harder)
And if you really need me, you gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta got to love me harder
(Imma love you harder)
Love me, love me, love me
Harder, harder, harder
(Love me, love me, baby)
Love me, love me, love me
(Just a little bit harder, harder, a little bit)

Libra let's see what do we have for you let's see so we have I don't care what people think anymore I've been given bad advice I am listening to my intuition I know you are the one what why do you feel why do I feel so lost painful memories people don't believe in me I cannot stop thinking about you okay so Libra you have someone here who is thinking obviously a lot about you uh I'm getting like people people here as well so what I am getting Libra is that um it feels like more people have been involved in that situation in this situation I'm getting also very strongly that this is someone who was giving a really bad advice they figure it out that someone who gave that advice to them didn't have the best interest at heart regarding this situation um yeah I feel that you didn't here with someone who is also quite insecure people don't believe in me I feel this person has a lot to prove it's like they feel that they have a lot to prove to [Music] others why I why do I feel so lost painful memories yeah you might be dealing here Libra with someone with the baggage you know there is a need for them to release something that it's been kind of um hanging um over their head metaphorically saying like a Dark Cloud at the moment it feels here that this is someone who is quite lost I feel that this person emotionally is a little bit all over the place but they are claiming here that they know that you are the one mhm let's see let's see Libra could you please show me this person's energy and feelings towards Libra in this connection please so we have 10 of Cups nine of Pentacles a page of Wands four of Wands 10 of Wands with the seven of Pentacles Two of Wands nine of Wands and the magician okay this person's energy and feelings towards Libra in this connection 10 of Cups nine of Pentacles page of Wands for 10 of wand yeah you see 10 of Wands it's that baggage that we've been that I've mentioned before it feels like they do have this person is carrying a heavy baggage seven of Pentacles and it's very difficult for them to release it because it feels that it's like this person has been attached to this thing for quite some time it's very difficult to release it you have someone here Libra with the 10 of Cups nine of Pentacles who doesn't want to be by their own who doesn't want to be single anymore or feel that way page of Wands with the four of Wands they do want to express that they want to be with you very much [Music] mhm Two of Wands nine of Wands and the magician yeah I feel this is someone here who've learned their lesson they are now very guarded because someone with the magician was trying to manipulate this person you know magician when it's not greatly aspected can represents like a trickster someone who wants to trick us and it feels that's the case Two of Wands I feel this person is thinking about you but also about what happened here about that advice that someone else gave them and I feel this person wants to understand why why would someone act that way [Music] mhm you might be dealing uh Libra with Virgo Gemini let's see could you please show me Libra's energy and feelings towards this person and this connection please let's see we have three of Pentacles The Chariot Five of Swords the lovers mhm Queen of Swords Knight of Cups the hangedman three of Cups and Ace of Swords okay what I am getting here Libra is that with the hangman three of Cups and Ace of Swords I'm seeing you making this I feel that you made the decision that you are not going to be the first one approaching this person in order to change the circumstances between the two of you the hangman it's a very very passive energy three of Cups and Ace of Swords yeah in order to um kind of have a Reconciliation or reconnect with this person and have a solid conversation I feel that you are seeing this situation for what it is and it feels like the ball is in this person's Court they need to make a move if they truly care mhm Five of Swords with the lovers yeah there is some sort of kind of there was some sort of kind of form of manipulation regarding this connection and I feel that you see this person as someone who it's like it they were able to avoid it and they still chose to kind of um act in a certain way it's like I feel okay I feel Libra that for some of you you've kind of mentioned to this person that you don't fully trust that that another person or it's like you have your reservations yeah and it's like yeah they acting like your friend threee of Pentacles they are trying to be very care very helpful that another individual who gave them better advice right but it's like I feel that you you could have it's like you youve you saw through this person and it's like I'm getting here that you are disappointed that this person got very easily manipulated yeah queen of that's why I feel that now you embodying the energy of Queen of Swords you are very firm very assertive regarding certain things I feel that yes that you would welcome communication from this person but this is someone who really needs to um needs to mean business it's like they really need to show you that they're are honest because I feel that you will not accept any BS and only an apology this is someone I feel that you feel very strongly about this person apologizing to you mhm Libra you might be dealing with another Libra we have a Taurus we also have cancerian energy with the Chariot Gemini Pisces okay let's see crosswatchers the roll can be reversed let's see could you please show me the outcome have the devil card here could you please show me the outcome six of Wands the devil card 10 of Swords Ace of Pentacles King Of Wands nine of Cups page of Swords with the four of Swords Three of Wands and Eight of Cups yeah I feel that at the moment there is no progress for some of you it's like you are not on a speaking term so you're having quiet days with the four of Swords Three of Wands it's a passive energy it's like waiting for the right moment to take action and Eight of Cups it might be a case that at the moment there is this kind of emotional distance between the two of you right we have six of Wands the devil card and 10 of Swords I am getting here quite strongly Libra that this person is going to tell you that they are going to release something that no longer serves a purpose in their life uh the devil card with the T of Swords is like I know I need to surrender to the fact that it's time for me to walk away for something that has been burdening me who's who who maybe it's a person that has been uh tiring draining and exhausting because that is essentially uh the devil card with the 10 of Swords can represent someone who's making decision of surrounding to the fact that they need to release something and they're going to do it because it's like there is no other way around about this situation it's like it's time you need to release it because that is the core of the problems and issues in your life essentially and I'm seeing them with the six of with the six of Wands it's like someone is overcoming obstacles and I feel this person really wants to tell you that that they've made that decision that now they've realized something they are ready to do it so it's like I'm getting someone trying to inform you that uh Al kind of express to you that they are going through a big big change but this change is for the better the devil card here can represent you know unhealthy habits um something that's been toxic for quite some time in this person's life mhm and it's been very challenging for them to release it we have Ace of Pentacles as a energy that's bonding yeah I'm seeing this person wanting to tell you that they see things differently um that they um like starting over something like this this card also suggest here that there is uh still a big potential when it comes to this connection Libra with the Ace of Pentacles and then we have King Of Wands nine of Cups and page of Swords I feel that you have many questions or you are quite curious about something here with the nine of Cups you will get what you want from this situation Libra and it feels that whatever that might be uh you I feel that you will overall you'll be very happy and very satisfied with the outcome of this situation mhm there is something here Libra about you believing in this person but it's like it was so disappointed disappointing that they allowed this situation to happen at the first place mhm so I'm seeing this person um trying to to kind of you know um Express something to you that is very significant for them mhm Libra you might be dealing with um with with Capricorn with this energy you might be dealing with Capricorn Libra I will leave it here thank you

(Lyrics):
[Intro]
I must be crazy now
Maybe I dream too much
But when I think of you
I long to feel your touch

[Verse 1]
To whisper in your ear
Words that are old as time
Words only you would hear
If only you were mine
I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do
And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side

[Chorus]
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

[Verse 2]
So today, I finally find the courage deep inside
Just to walk right up to your door
But my body can't move when I finally get to it
Just like a thousand times before
Then without a word he handed me this letter
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said

[Chorus]
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

[Verse 3]
Well maybe I, I need a little love yeah
And maybe I, I need a little care
And maybe I, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you
Oh you need somebody just to hold you
If you do, just reach out and I'll be there

[Chorus]
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

[Outro]
These three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Oh, I love you
Please say you love me too
Please please
Say you love me too
Till the end of time
My baby
Together, together, forever
Till the end of time
I love you
I will be your light
Shining bright
Shining through your eyes
My baby

Darling, I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl, it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
If you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be?
Oh, God, give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee

I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

reading",24,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology),2024-12-21T21:30:37Z,0:11:22,8577,90,True,tarot first what's up Aries thank you for clicking on this video and welcome to your tarot card reading if you remember FYI this is a wave 2 reading just coming out for you a little bit late but we're going to be looking mostly at your love life but we'll do a couple spiritual messages from the Oracle deck before we dive into what your person is thinking about you and what to expect from them right comment below where your Aries placement is in your chart probably you're in Aries Sun but maybe you got Aries in other areas and um yeah let us know let us know how you're doing comment whatever you want so we got flying popping out of the shuffle as well as storm uh let's do a couple more for that then what else do we got for you Aries coming through searching Corridor and abandonment all right forgive me I'm a little bit sick getting over a flu um but it sure doesn't stop me so we got flying in storm and the first thing that I get from the these two cards is very strongly all right so with with what we got on the table I feel like you guys are going through it a little bit there's some kind of drama some kind of like a feeling of upheaval not like a tower moment but I just feel like there's a little bit of a dramatic energy um around you right now so you're upset about something I see some of you wanting to be confrontational with somebody or a couple people um that's the storm I feel like there's just emotions coming up but they're coming up from within you remember that uh that these emotions whatever you feel this energy is coming up from within you you have a lot of that um you have a lot of emotions as an Aries and you can either direct them in a good direction for you and make it work for you that empowers you and gives you that Emperor energy or you can disperse it and Scatter it by acting out here and there which weakens you in the end but with flying coming in so this is asking you Aries to First it's saying that you can weather whatever this storm is you can fly right through it it's not enough to take you off of your path to take you out of your flight to knock you over unless you let it the energy here is you know it can't stop you unless you want it to it also wants you to fly up and above it and get perspective so if you've ever been in an airplane some of you might have done that before if you like fly through like a storm cloud eventually you just fly up and it's sunny again and you realize that was just like a layer like a different version of reality like a different perception and that's how you kind of got to look at what's going on with you right now is you can fly right out of it get that greater perspective and it won't affect you because you'll be above it Petty drama might be a thing someone's trying or something's trying to you know take you and keep you in some kind of petty drama searching Corridor and abandonment um you're looking in all the wrong places right now because you feel very lonely very alone and that's steering you in the wrong direction I feel like don't look for people right now to be fulfilling your loneliness you've got to be able to tend to yourself right now and then look for people that accentuate or complement your positive energy right so if you're in a negative state right now if you're feeling very bad um looking for someone to basically come save you is really going to be counterintuitive in the end and remember that cuz it's really important for you right now reflection coming out that came out for Virgo as well so you got Virgo placements that was a really big card for the Virgo reading I feel like it's time to take a good look at yourself have a little fun with Mischief the philosopher beautiful blue tones coming out here at the bottom um look at your mistakes right now in a way what what you feel are your mistakes I don't really feel like mistakes are mistakes in the way that we think they are look at what you feel you've done wrong or how you've been wronged all right but this is especially not really how you've been wrong this is about your actions and stuff like that think about them for a moment from a place of how can I learn from this how can I grow from this how can this accentuate my positive aspects or energies uh with the philosopher coming out with the reflection of Mischief this is really really really a time to be learning very deeply about what you perceive to be your mistakes if you just think oh I up and then you move on I'm not going to do that again cuz I  up there's more to it than you just messed up you have to really look at it and think about everything behind it it's showing that there's more more to learn from these situations especially in the past I feel like this is a moment of growth for you where you're basically using your perception to rise above really really harsh energies you're learning from the past and you're going to start looking romantically for a different type of energy than you've usually been looking as soon as you can really tend to what feels like a loneliness or desperation searching within emptiness or something like that your person we'll be looking in the extended in um at the future outcome of the situation as well as clarifying the spread that I get excuse me I just ate um something in my teeth some some of you may need a bit of a cleansing some of you may have said things that you really regret I'm feeling like a verbal cleanse realizing that what you say comes from you T of Swords all right there's a lot of hurt and betrayal there with you and it's kind of blinding you right now don't let it again look at these things as learning points but you know we got that storm energy around you guys is a really difficult moment I feel like especially in love for some of you maybe I'm also hearing that some of you are just learning from the past and this energy doesn't have to be part of your present unless you let it so maybe the storm and then Rising above it you know all that hurt anger uh loneliness sorrow is maybe the storm itself and consciously getting out of it will you make that choice or will you linger in it why would lingering in it you know Empower you more than getting out of it which one's easier to do you know what I mean if you want true abundance true stability you'll make the moves right now that get it to you those moves aren't always easy like I was saying in the Virgo reading it's it's harder to move out of these difficult energies and and make that choice for yourself than to stay in them cuz if you stay in a negative energy you're not doing anything you're just stay in there you know what I mean and that's not that's not hard to stay in it it's hard to move out of it change your perception change your mind Knight of Cups wants you to open your heart and move towards uh something better something greater all right so this person Aries what are they thinking towards you what are they giving at this time what's coming up for this person for Aries could be a Libra with the Queen of Swords other air placements as well Gemini I want to say Sagittarius it's not air uh as well as aquarius so the first thing that comes to my mind is they want to throw it all away um and I know that sounds a little bit negative but so this person's basically basically saying like I Carri this and now what again it feels like the Virgo energy some of you like I'm not going to keep saying that but some of you have this this weird uh Virgo connection at this time so they're making a decision right now they're thinking about the relationship and they feel that they have a weight on their shoulders whether they want to continue to carry this weight or not um for some of you not carrying this weight is this person walking away and for some of you not carrying this weight is this person totally refreshing but we're about to see a very big change in this person's mentality personally I don't like this mentality it's very negative and it's very closed off so they're not really communicating with you very much um and when somebody makes themselves so responsible for everything in a relationship that's a toxic trait to be honest um you're making yourself responsible then because you're not you don't know how to communicate and make it equal so this person's not doing that with you and they're keeping a lot inside energies could be reversed what else do we got coming out for this person from my Aries the change is good the change is positive um the change gives way to more openness and more love how are you feeling my Aries you're confused you haven't really seen the light yet there's a very reflective quality in this relationship where right now you're kind of mirroring each other but you're also going to be projecting with this person What You observe what you see and what you feel again a lot of that I can't stress it in any other way it's coming from you more than it might be coming from them this is just it's it's a small period transient where there's just a lot of reflection and projection going on so be aware of that so you can learn from this again going back to the philosopher mischief and the reflection cards that we got uh you'll be able to learn quite a bit about yourself through whatever is going on right now up until the change that I see coming in which is a positive change that opens them up and I think allows reality allows Clarity to come through in this connection here's that Virgo energy again with the hermit coming in let me get this on of my teeth sorry guys not sorry all right this plan one of you guys I'm not sure who I think it's both of you you're definitely in this very introverted kind of closed off I don't have enough to give to the other person right now energy whether you're aware of it or not and I feel like you guys what's basically happening is you guys are trying to make it work when you just you like yeah I don't feel like you guys should really be trying so hard in a relationship right now if it's not coming easy that means you got to like just chill out for a second I see the Breakthrough coming when you guys are able to be there for each other but right now I don't think you guys are and a lot of you guys are struggling and trying so hard to make it work it's like you're trying to like make a pizza but like you don't have an oven so like you're using the stove top and you just realize like you're out of flour so you're using like rice flour and it's just like all right wait till you can go to the grocery store and get the right ingredients wait till you have an oven you know but you're not you're being impatient what else is coming out it's it's a period of the dark so you're going to be facing the difficult energies right now when you move away from that I feel like it's going to get a lot better there's going to be a really positive breakthrough coming through for you guys um but right now tend to yourself and don't worry so much about this person I want to say let's clarify this more in the extended and take a look at Future outcomes there Aries that'll be in the description box below thank you very much,{}
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjASGCMDnSM,My Mom Picked 3 Girls To Love Me | @LoveBusterShow,"Would you want there to be a test that helps you pick out a romantic partner? 

A wealthy woman was holding a competition among girls. She invited a few gals to her mansion and would test their talents and looks in various ways. When she finally picked her favorites, she explained to them what they were here for. She really wanted grandchildren. But her son wasn’t interested in that kind of thing. That’s why the lady decided to take matters into her own hands. “The first one of you to get pregnant from my son will become his wife and inherit his fortune”, the woman said.

Then, she called over her son. It was a man with a clearly upset expression sitting in a wheelchair. The lady instructed the girls to meet him in private one by one to get the “thing” done.

Is Qadar Tumse Pyar Ho Gaya... 
Lyrics :-

Is Qadar Tumse Humein Pyar Ho Gaya
Hadd Se Zyada Hadd Se Paar Ho Gaya

Is Qadar Tumse Humein Pyar Ho Gaya
Hadd Se Zyada Hadd Se Paar Ho Gaya
Din Teri Chahaton Mein Guzarne Lage
Dil Kahe Har Ghadi Tumse Milne Chalein

Pehlu Mein Hardam Baithe Rahein
Doobe Rahein Tere Aankhon Mein
Is Qadar Tumse Humein Pyar Ho Gaya
Hadd Se Zyada Hadd Se Paar Ho Gaya

Humein Ishq Hai Teri Yaadon Se
Humein Ishq Hai Teri Baaton Se
Tere Nind Mein Aate Khwabon Se
Tere Sath Hui Mulaqaton Se

Mujhe Ishq Hai Tere Chune Se
Mujhe Ishq Hai Tera Hone Se
Tere Hath Mein Apne Hathon Se
Tere Sath Kate Din Raaton Se

Chehre Ko Tere Dekha Karein
Chehre Ko Tere Dekha Karein
Leke Tujhe In Bahon Mein

Is Qadar Tumse Humein Pyar Ho Gaya
Hadd Se Zyada Hadd Se Paar Ho Gaya

Aankhein Yeh Mujhse Kahe
Bas Tumko Yeh Takti Rahein
Tu Hi Tu Basa Dil Mein Hardum Bepanah

Dil Toh Chahe Dede Tujhko
Phoolon Se Bhari Raahein
Tumhari Har Ada Tumahri Har Nazar
Pe Hum Marne Lage
Un Pe Hum Marne Lage

Is Kadar Tumse Pyaar Ho Gaya
Is Kadar Dil Nisaar Ho Gaya
Is Kadar Bekaraar Ho Gaya
Is Kadar Ab Khumaar Ho Gaya

Is Qadar Tumse Pyaar Ho Gaya
Is Qadar Dil Nisaar Ho Gaya
Is Qadar Bekaraar Ho Gaya
Is Qadar Ab Khumaar Ho Gaya

upload but I put on a wig and glasses so no one at school recognizes me sometimes I wish I didn't have to hide but my parents worry all the attention would be bad for my education I understand but sometimes I just wish I had someone I could talk to I look down and I accidentally walk right into gray oh my God I'm so sorry I didn't see you there the handsome new boy at school he Winks at me and walks away I can't help but blush he's incredibly Charming then he suddenly stops and turns around making my heart stop actually what's your name I'm Abigail what's yours I'm gray we'll see you around later that day I was sitting by a tree with my best friend Skyler wow this gray guy sounds like he has a huge crush on you you think so I don't know he seemed kind of Moody to me no no you're looking at it all wrong since he moved here from Rome he hasn't talked to any of the girls wow I didn't know he was so aloof okay I guess that does make me feel special it should he's so hard to get through to I heard he's part of the boxing club where they beat up boys who don't have proper manners he's such a bad boy okay I guess that's pretty neat exactly and he's totally dreamy as well what do you think should I try to get a his phone number oh yes absolutely he's the guy to date in school a few minutes later I run out the front door of the school and I can't believe my eyes parked right in front of the school is a shiny black car out of the car steps Thomas W wo that's my old neighbor Thomas he and I were best friends until he moved to New York because his dad bought a professional sports team and now he goes to one of the best soccer cies in the world what's he doing here I thought he was living in New York still there's my favorite Abigail Thomas runs over to me and wraps me in a giant hug spinning me in the air oh how much I missed you Thomas I missed you so much and you've gotten so much more handsome since the last time I saw you that was years ago I mean you won't believe how much training I'm doing for my Soccer Academy you think I'm training for the Olympics Thomas finally notices Skyler and gives her a small nod Skyler is too nervous to say anything else Thomas turns back to me beautiful smile on his face so I'll be back here in school until I leave for our next soccer tournament so can we please please catch up until then yeah like fun me good it's a date I'll see you tonight I can't believe he's back and neither can I I glance over Thomas's [Music] shoulder and see gray walking through the parking lot I'm so confused everything's happening so fast I don't know what to do I agree to go to dinner tonight with Thomas but he doesn't know I have to record a video tonight for my followers if I don't my agent will be super upset also I can't decide how I feel about gray does he really have a crush on me I hope he doesn't hear him going to dinner with Thomas I only look at Thomas as a friend oh Charlie walked into the library and he's heading towards me how I've always thought he was so cute and Charming Abigail I didn't know you were here today but I wouldn't expect anything less from the smartest girl in school Charlie you know that's not true you've always beaten me on like every quiz well maybe it's true but I'm sure you can catch up soon Charlie flashes a bright smile at me I Smile Back has Charlie gotten taller since I saw him last he pulls up a chair beside me so what are you studying today oh nothing right now I just needed some time to think I hear you I love coming to the library to think it's quiet and I love to smell books on the shelves so do I hey if you aren't busy later I'm going to be studying for the quiz next week would you want to join so we can study together and catch up before I can answer Thomas walks right up to us where did he come from I'm sorry Abigail won't be able to join you tonight she's actually going out to dinner with me Thomas where did you come from look I don't know who you are but you need to back off my friend I'm Charlie and you don't own her I don't even know who you are Thomas and I just move back and Abigail and I we go way back tell them Abigail oh well yeah Thomas you are a great friend but Charlie you are a great friend too okay it doesn't matter but what does matter is which one of us you're going to spend time with tonight I paused for a moment my mind racing with thoughts I have to record a video for my followers I can't hang out with any of them tonight what am I going to do I brush my hair back from my face um I gray appears in the library out of nowhere has he been here the whole time boys should stop putting so much pressure on her if she wanted to hang out with you I think she would have said something so let's just respect her space gr where did you come from oh I mean I love libraries books are one of life's greatest Joys I'm sorry who asked for your opinion you didn't ask you're just telling her what to do now that's my point Thomas and gray glare at each other Charlie throws up his hands in frustration so what's it going to be tonight Abigail I go not sure what to do well as much as I appreciate you all I actually can't do anything tonight I'm not available that sucks why I I um I actually have a family thing tonight uh sorry I I I can't make it unfortunately there you go now you're standing up for yourself I will see around thanks gray gray disappears I watch him go and already feel myself missing him Thomas crosses his arms in frustration I don't like waiting Abigail my father wouldn't stand for this but I suppose I could be a more patient man well have to meet up soon at your convenience Thomas storms off I'm sorry we couldn't study tonight Abigail Charlie walks away gliding through the library shelves I sit alone in the library well still without my friends what am I going to do all three of them are so wonderful and dreamy but in such different ways is it possible I could see Thomas as more than a friend who is gray and when did Charlie become so handsome so fast the next day I'm sitting in the library and Skylar's pacing up and down behind me trying to get a grip on the [Music] situation so let me get this straight you had all three boys in the palm of your hand and didn't end up going out with any of them last night Thomas and Charlie asked me out C didn't oh he's probably just playing games I'm sure he wants to see you he's just acting cool how do you know that he could have a girlfriend he doesn't I asked around that afternoon I sat alone in the lunch tables when I saw gray approach me with the lunch tray and sit across from me hey there oh hi gray I wanted to see you today and let you know I wasn't trying to be your night in shining armor back in the library what do you mean I saw Thomas and Charlie fighting over you and I thought it was disrespectful well I appreciate you and I don't know you but I think you are a good guy why is that because bad people don't do things like that you don't know maybe I am a bad person what if I'm just talking to you because you have a pretty face well are you I I guess we'll see I'll see you around gray leaves and I sit alone in the lunch tables feeling like I could fall for him in an instant after lunch I needed some me time so I went to the field I need to find the perfect outfit for my shoot this weekend something casual but cheek Charlie sits down next to me hey hi Charlie brought you a surprise wow Charlie this is very thoughtful and very sweet thank you you know since um you didn't go for my study date idea I decid to bring the date to you Charlie this is all very sweet and very very thoughtful well a special girl like you deserves a special meal you really think I'm special you're one of the most incredible people I've ever met you're smart you're funny and I Just Can't Take My Eyes Off You Charlie I don't know what to say this is a very unexpected date thank you anytime maybe if you're free this weekend we can go see a movie that sounds like a lot of fun I guess we're going on a date no way yes it was a date and he brought me a picnic basket and everything wow that's so cute did you kiss him no but I think I wanted to with the end oh wow you guys are so cute I wish you had Charlie is such a cat she would be the cutest couple in school you think so should I dat Charlie do you think I could trust him with my secret not sure he seems like a nice guy oh my gosh Thomas you did all of this for me of course I got these flowers imported from Ecuador and this suit cost a Fortune Too these are beautiful so are you come to dinner with me I won't take not for an answer it's the end of the school day where do you want to go I know this Italian restaurant you'll love my driver will take us there and I have a dress for you all picked out to change into okay let's [Music] go oh no now we have another day that evening I'm sitting beside Thomas in the back of his fancy car wearing a stunning black dress we just had an incredible dinner it was so much fun being fancy I'm so glad you came out with me tonight yeah it was great I can't believe we've been friends for so many years yeah it's been it's been pretty crazy but now I have to ask if you want to consider being being more more more than friends oh Thomas I don't know I mean I have so much to offer I've known you for so long and the whole future could be taken care of because of my family's fortune that does sound incredible I care about you all I ask is if you care about me then you cut these other men out your life who Charlie and that weird kid gray I don't like seeing you around them and you're just a different class of people from them I just don't want you to be their friends oh that seems harsh they are nice people too are you in love with them no well I don't know they're all kind in their own way well could you ever love me instead I do love you Thomas I just don't know if it'ss in a romantic way yeah if you want your dreams to all come true then I really hope the answer to that question is yes the next day I'm sitting at a desk alone in the classroom I got here early because I just needed some time to think I don't know what to do about these boys Charlie is so sweet and very handsome I've just known Thomas for longer and also it's so fun to be around him but also I don't know if I just see Thomas as just as a friend I need to stop thinking about all of this last night I missed recording because I couldn't stop thinking about all of this gra walks into the classroom you look stressed it's been a rough few days okay yeah it sounds rough first Charlie and then Thomas wait how do you know about that have you been following me I haven't been following you don't flatter yourself I have eyes and I pay attention to things well good for you in fact you won't believe all the things that these eyes have seen what do you mean I know you're a secret I recognized you the first time that we met what's the famous girl like you doing out of high [Music] school I love my friends and I love it here please don't tell anyone okay I haven't and I'm not going to I just want to let you know that I see you well thanks I think and you're doing such a good job balancing it all thanks why are you telling telling me all of this no I'm telling you this because I don't think you realize how important it is that you pick the right boy to go with your lifestyle you know you need someone that can be discreet oh yeah then who would that be me obviously didn't we have something going the first time we ran into each other I don't know what to say don't say anything okay I got to study for this quiz [Music] I think you're right I know and the night came Skyler and I waited inside a classroom she paided us back and forth nervously which also made me nervous when are the boys getting here anytime now what's your decision I don't know I just want to be honest with them I'm hoping I picked the right boy how are you going to know who to heck I'm hoping I'll know it in the moment once I see it in their faces good luck here they come the three boys approach Charlie then Thomas finally gray at the back wind blowing in their hair you all look incredibly handsome hiel hello there abigil what is it that you wanted to talk to me about and why are these two here here yeah what's this all about I think she's going to choose is that right Abigail well tell them it's me why would she choose you because I've known her the longest in my family's worth of Fortune you really think you'll get her because what you read a few books what your problem man boys please just let the poor lady speak I think she's trying to say something I step forward I have to be brave I I brought you all here because I wanted to talk to you okay get on with it h look from boy to boy I take a deep breath it's now or never what do I really want I want my future to be my own and to do that I have to focus on my career and not get distracted by boys who will make my life all about them well you're all very kind and special to me in your own way Charlie you're very sweet and gentle and Thomas you're an old friend and generous and gray you're very loyal and perceptive what but right now I need to focus on myself I've messed up some really important things because of you guys like what that that doesn't make sense you know I hear you I respect that thank you gray that's all the explanation I can give right now and I hope you guys can respect it this sounds ridiculous yeah I I don't even know what to make your face Thomas storms off Good Riddance well if you ever change your mind you could probably find me in the library Charlie Smiles sadly and walks away I miss seeing that kind smile so you stood up for yourself yeah I did I just need to really focus on the success my music videos are giving me right now good for you I like that I'll uh I'll see you around gray Smiles at me it makes me almost fall for him all over again gray walks away and it takes all my strength not to call after him wow you did it you picked the right person who was that yourself I'm so proud of you you think so you think I made the right choice oh yes you did and trust me those boys aren't going anywhere when the time is right you'll know it yeah you're right got to get home to

congregate in a manner to where not awkward bro you have the issue you have the problem right or wrong I don't have a beef with you I keep telling you that I don't have no problem with you you good bro you got the kid you got my dog you got you got the house you got the girl so I know you're not thinking about see that's where you hold hold on that's where you wrong bro like I told you this last time we talked I'm here to assist you I'm we don't talk though don't you want to know what's stopping us from getting to know each other you bro these conversations if they're not going to push us forward bro what what we need to talk about cuz eventually I'm going just get tired of damn talking my job is to take care of this household take care of them kids take care of my kid keep making sure I'm putting food in this damn house making sure these bills get paid on time ain't going to lie bro there's nothing in this world that can keep me from my kids bro for one my question is can you have kids and even if you can when you come across people that have children it's almost as if I feel you want to overc conversate and it's not because it's about me it's because you don't have your own biological no listen no no I'm going tell you what it is as a man you have obligations and you have duties you take care of them no matter what the situation how was raised is when a man comes in someone's life then they they obviously have an initial conversation with the man who is the father of their children first but you got to be a present though you got to be present though I think Marquez has a little bit of I'm not going to say hate I would say maybe a little jealousy I don't know if Marquez actually appreciates and understands the quality of man and and the caliber of man that his kids are are you know allowed to have in their lives takes a strong will person a disciplined person it it takes a devoted person to especially take care of another person's kids you know so um yeah for sure I was definitely throwing that shot at Marquez when you're not present you allow me the outsider guy to to to build a relationship with you not being there and what that what happens with that is is zarya goes to school and talks about me and not you and you the day after Father's Day fault is that whose fault is that I feel like it's TR fault no that's your fault bro you're not there actually you know what it's all our fault no it's not about being present it's about who's there I'm present every day bro it's hard to step in a in a in a place to where you're trying to accommodate another person and and they're not doing their job so you you're trying to work for two you're trying to do your job and trying to do their job you don't feel like you owe me anything and be honest no I feel like I'm compensating for you didn't do her losing her mom and her daddy and then you running off and leaving like you couldn't be there for her and this I feel like I'm taking let me hold hold wait let me let me let me just say this I do I do want us but who can say that I wasn't there for you though I saw all I saw your mom your sister and your dad all dead on the grany you

conversation I'll be quiet go ahead finish I'm that's not why I came over here I came over here to say I just want us all to be culture that's what I was going to say until you start bling off at the mouth like you time I want to my KY let me say I say I want to say I want us all to be peaceful I mean he out here telling folks that I'm not signing papers well I got them  notorized the other day

O lavaan ishqe de ambri udaariyan
Sanu pyar diyan chadiyan khumarian

O lawan ishqe de ambri udarian
Mainu pyar diyan chadiyan khumarian
Mainu pyar diyan chadiyan khumarian

Aa mere pair na zameen utte lagde
Pair na zameen uttey lagde
Lakhan chashme mohabbatan de wagde
Aa raati mitthe-mitthe supne vi thugde

Na gal mere vass di rahi (x2)

O kisse aisiyan nighahan mainu takkeya
Aisiyan nighahan mainu takkeya
Chahunde hoye vi na dil ruk sakkeya
Gaya pair ishqe de vich rakheya

Na gal mere vas di rahi (x2)

O kise aisiyan nigahan mainu takkeya

O lavaan bahan ch samet kayenaat main
Dassan kehnu-kehnu ishqe di baat main

O lavaan bahan ch samet kayenaat main
Dassan kehnu-kehnu ishqe di baat main
Dassan kehnu-kehnu ishqe di baat main

Aa rang phullan da vi hor gooda ho gaya
Phullan da vi hor gooda ho gaya
Paani pyar wala pattiyan nu dho gaya
Ajj ossda deedaar mainu ho gaya

Na gal mere vass di rahi (x2)

Aa kisse aisiyan nighahan mainu takkeya
Aisiyan nighahan mainu takkeya
Jiyunde hoye vi na dil ruk sakkeya
Gaya pair ishqe de vich rakheya

Na gal mere was di rahi (x2)
O kisse aisiyan nighahan mainu takkeya

Badi lambi ae kahani
Mere pyar di

O badi lambi ae kahani mere pyar di
Aave sang jadon sheesha main nihardi
Aave sang jadon sheesha main nihardi

Akh layi na odon di kangi waayi na
Layi na odon di kangi waayi na
Na hi das hundi jandi vi chupayi na
Kahi naina ne samajh ohnu aayi na

Na gal mere vas di rahi (x2)
Aa kisse aisiyan nighahan mainu takkeya
Aisiyan nighahan mainu takkeya
Jiyunde hoye vi na dil ruk sakkeya
Gaya pair ishqe de vich rakheya

Na gal mere wass di rahi
Na gal mere wass di rahi

O kisse aisiyan nighahan mainu takkeya
Nigah jiste sawalli hove
Rabb di rahi

O nigah jiste sawalli hove rabb di
Sache ishqe di laag ohnu lagdi

O nigah jiste sawalli hove rabb di
Sache ishqe di laag ohnu lagdi

Aa rom-rom ch Satinder hai wasseya
Rom ch Satinder hai wasseya
Meri apni parandi mainu dasseya
Jadon tak mainu minna jeya hasseya

Na gal mere vass di rahi (x2)
Aa kisse aisiyan nighahan mainu takkeya

You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me to the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a holy grail I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (yeah)
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (yeah)
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (oh)

Lyrics:
Cold bones
Yeah, that's my love
She hides away
Like a ghost
Ooh, does she know that we bleed the same?
Ooh, don't wanna cry but I break that way

Cold sheets
Oh, where's my love?
I am searching high
I'm searching low in the night
Ooh, does she know that we bleed the same?
Ooh, don't wanna cry but I break that way

Did she run away, did she run away?
I don't know
If she ran away, if she ran away
Come back home
Just come home

I got a fear
Oh, in my blood
She was carried up
Into the clouds high above
Ooh, if you bled, I'll bleed the same
Ooh, if you're scared, I'm on my way

Did you run away, did you run away?
I don't need to know
If you ran away, if you ran away
Come back home
Just come home

Nahin marna ganwaara pyaar
Mein tum se ye kehana hai
Tumhe bhi zinda rehana hai
Mujhe bhi zinda rehana hai




Kabhi aasaan kabhi mushkil
Ajab hai pyaar ki raahe
Kabhi aasaan kabhi mushkil
Ajab hai pyaar ki raahe
Magar jo pyaar karate hain
Kabhi bharate nahin aahen
Hawaao ne ye kaha
Fizaao ne ye kaha
Aai pyaar ki ye rrut badi
Tufaani tu darna na o meri rani
Badalega ye mausam ari deewaani
Ham likhenge prem kahani
Kabhi aasaan kabhi mushkil
Ajab hai pyaar ki raahe
Kabhi aasaan kabhi mushkil
Ajab hai pyaar ki raahe
Magar jo pyaar karate hain

Gardish me hi sahi ye

Gardish me hi sahi ye
Sitaare hamnashin
Dhoondhegi kal hame ye
Bahaare hamnashin
Imtehaan pyaar
Ke roz hote nahin
Pyaar waale kabhi
Sabr khote nahi
Mohabbat ho hi jaati hai
Mohabbat ki nahi jaati
Ye aisi chiz hai jo sabake
Hisse me nahi aati

email chaos? The brand new iOS 18
mail update is here, and it's either going to be
your secret weapon or your biggest nightmare. Stick around and find out. I'm Dylan Stewart,
The MacWhisperer. And in this video,
we're going to dive into the brand new iOS
18 mail app, which has some brand new features
like categorization that people are either
loving or hating. Once you know how
to use it, you can decide for yourself. Make sure to stick around
for my MacWhisperer Power Tip, where I deliver
some powerful tools that will change how
you use mail forever. Let's hop on over to the
phone and get started. When you first jump into
the Mail app, you'll usually find yourself
in this view, which is called the Inbox view. But to really understand
how to get around the Mail app, we need to take a
step backwards by clicking our back arrow in the
upper left hand corner here, and starting off
in the Mailboxes view. In the Mailboxes view,
you'll see mailboxes for any email accounts
you've configured . Up at the top, we've got
a section called the Favorites section. The Favorites section
is really helpful because it's completely
customizable. By clicking on the Edit
button in the upper right hand corner, you
can turn off or on any email accounts that
you've got configured. And if you continue to
scroll down, you'll find some really valuable tools
like the VIP section, the Flag section, the
Remind Me section, or even the ability to
turn on your All Trash, All Sent, All Junk, and
all drafts section so that you always have
all your email without hunting around through
the separate accounts. The favorites section
is so powerful that you can add any mailbox
from any account into this section by coming
down to the bottom and choosing add mailbox. Go into whatever email
account that mailbox is located in and just click
on it and click done. Now that mailbox will
show up right at the top of your favorites
section making it really easy for you to get to
that important mailbox. without having to
scroll through all of these other accounts. In fact, if you set up
your favorite section properly, you can usually
turn off all the accounts you see down here by
clicking the arrow to the right and just closing
them up to save space and make it easier to navigate
through your entire mailbox without without
having to scroll around. Take a few moments and set
up your favorite section. Remember, pressing the
edit button will allow you to turn on or off any
accounts, and pressing and holding on the three lines
on the right side will allow you to move sections
up or down to make sure your favorite section
is perfectly configured and gives you everything
you need on one screen. Now let's hop into our
All Inboxes section right here and take a look
at the Inboxes view. The first major change
you'll see in iOS 18's Mail app shows
up in the Inbox view. It's called the Priority
section and the Priority section looks through your
inbox for email messages that maybe you missed but
that are really important. And it brings them right
up to the top to make it easy to Click on them
and address that issue quickly and simply. The priorities are
automatic, so there's nothing you can do to
force something to show up there, but in most cases,
it finds the messages that need your attention
and brings them up so you can find them easily. The next thing you're
going to notice about this new iOS 18 update
is the categories that we see up at the top. We're used to seeing
all of our message in the inbox without any
categorization, but in this new update, Apple
has separated out your inbox into four separate
categories to make sure you can find the most
important messages and not get overwhelmed
by all the junk. The first section is
the primary section, and that's where you'll
find all your email conversations with the
people and the companies that you work with
on a regular basis. Moving one section over
to the right, you'll find the transactions section. In this section, you'll
find any orders, any purchases, any shipments,
any, well, transactions. If it has to do with
money, it's probably going to show up right here. Moving one more
section over to the right, and we end up
in the update section. The update section
highlights communication with companies, giving
you news, newsletters, and even social media
updates all in one place. Moving one over to
the right, We get into our Promotions tab. The Promotions tab is
where you'll find sales, coupons, and all sorts
of promotional emails. One of the things I
like best about the new categorization feature
is that it stacks emails on top of each other. So when I'm in the Update
section and I come down to delete this Tanner
Lee email, it's actually going to delete all
six emails from Tanner Lee at the same time. This is going to make
it so easy for me to quickly get caught
up on my promotion. promotional emails,
my updates and my transactions without
completely losing my mind. Sometimes something
gets put into the wrong category though
but there's a tool that can fix that. This John Smith
should actually be inside of my primary. So if I click on it
here and click on the three dots in the upper
right hand corner, I can categorize the sender
and make sure that he is always categorized
in the primary section. You can move things in
or out of any category by simply going up
to those three dots and recategorizing
that specific sender. As you continue to use
the Mail app, it gets smarter and smarter,
and the categorization gets better and better. Also, if you look over
in the Primary section, you'll see some messages
have a little colored icon to the right side, like
this Experian Alerts here, the Stripe Alert here, or
this Meeting Summary here. These are emails that
the iphone believes to be time sensitive, so
even though normally it would be an update, Or
a transaction, because it's time sensitive,
it automatically shows up in the primary
section to make sure that I don't miss it. Super helpful. But sometimes, you'll
be working on your mail app and you won't want
all of these categories. It's easy to temporarily
turn off the categories by simply tapping on
the active category a second time. So because primary
is currently active, if I tap on it again,
I go into All Mail. And if I was in the
Promotions section and tapped on Promotions
again, I would go into All Mail. When you're in the All
Mail section, you'll see everything from
every category without it being separated. And then it's easy to go
back to the categories by clicking on any one of the
sections and it resets it. This makes it so easy
to have categories. or turn them off if
you don't need to. But if you just hate the
category feature and want it gone forever that's
also really easy to do. By clicking on the three
dots in the upper right corner you can change from
the categories view to the list view which will
put everything back the way it was before iOS 18. Also from that same three
dots you can turn off the show priority if you
don't like that function or it's not accurate. Now let's talk about
some of the other tools that exist inside of
this inboxes view. First off in the lower
left hand corner we've got the mail filter. This is a super helpful
tool that gets overlooked or underutilized. Simply clicking on this
will hide any messages that have already been
read making sure that you only see the unread
messages . If you've got a ton of emails and you
just want to see the new ones this is going to
make it easy to find that. Notice in the bottom
middle where it says filtered by,
it shows unread. If you tap where it says
unread, you can add other options to the filter. You can turn on or off
any emails that you don't want it to search. You can turn on
or off flagged. or attachments, or VIPs,
or only mail sent today. You can make any of
these changes anytime you want and the
filter will immediately reflect those changes. So the next time you
come in and turn on the filter, it'll eliminate
anything that doesn't match those requirements. If you are going to change
your standard filter, I recommend coming back
and changing it to unread when you're done playing
around, because between you and I, that's the best
filter feature there is. Also, in the upper right
hand corner, you've got a Select button. The Select button can
allow you to easily select multiple messages, and
using the buttons down at the bottom, you can
click the Mark button to mark it as junk, mark
it as read, or flag it. You can click the move
button to move those messages into any
folder in any one of your email accounts. Or, you can just trash
it by clicking the trash button on the
bottom right corner. A little pro tip for
you when you're using the select function. If you put your finger
down on the circle on the left and just roll
downwards, you can select a large number of messages
without having to click them one at a time. This is really helpful
if you're in the update section or the promotion
section and you just want to clean house and get
rid of all of that junk that's been holding you
back since, well, forever. Next, let's talk about
the swiping tools that we can use from this view. We can swipe from either
the left side or the right side of any email
message, and depending on which way we swipe,
there's lots of options. Swiping from the
left to the right, we have two options. The Unread option,
which can mark a message as read or unread. And the Remind Me option. The Remind Me option will
set a reminder that will bring this email up to the
top of your inbox at the time that you specified
so that you can remember to reply to it or add
additional information in. Swiping from the right
side to the left side, we have three options. The trash option, the
option to flag a message. Flagging is really,
really helpful because it can allow you to
easily find specific kinds of messages. I use all kinds
of different flags in my mail. For example, one of my
flags tracks orders that have not yet arrived. One of them tracks bills. One of them tracks
travel itineraries. And one of them tracks
all the important messages that I want to make sure
I respond to quickly. And then we've also got
the More button here. The More button does
the exact same function as the Reply button,
which we'll talk about in just a moment. Another little pro
tip for you here. If you are doing a partial
swipe, you will then have to click the next button. But if you do a complete
swipe all the way from the left side to the
right side like this, it will automatically
perform the action. So from the left side
to the right side, it will turn this message
from unread to read. to read without my
having to stop and click in the middle. And again, if you do
a partial swipe from the right side, you'll
then have to click the separate options. But if you do a full
swipe from the right side to the left side, it
will immediately delete that message with one
clean, simple gesture. Now, let's step into the
message view by clicking on one of our emails. Once we're inside
of the message view, there's several
options we can use. Down in the lower left
hand corner, clicking the trash icon will
delete this message. Clicking the folder
icon will move this message into one of
our email folders. You'll notice here it
gives a suggestion at the bottom suggesting that
it should move it to sent messages, but if you click
up above where it says move message, you can
choose any folder from any account right from here. To the right of
that, we've got the Reply button. Clicking the Reply button
opens up a host of tools. You'll see Reply, Reply
All, Forward, and Trash. But if you continue
scrolling down, you'll find a section where you
can create a reminder, or set yourself a flag. Remember, you can set
flags in a number of different colors, allowing
you to categorize one color as one type of
email, and another color as something else, so
you can quickly locate things like your orders,
or your itineraries. Continuing to scroll
down, you've got a ton of other options, including
the Categorize Sender option, in case you need
to train this sender into a different category. But don't overlook
the fact that you can print your email from
right here as well. Clicking on this print
button will open up a screen allowing you to
connect to any wireless printers and allowing you
to print this message out right from your phone. In addition to that,
in the upper right hand corner we've got the
ability to click these arrows to go down to the
next message or up to the previous message. This can make it really
easy to look through a lot of your emails without
going back and forth to different screens. You can also click up at
the top right here to get more information about who
sent the message and if there were any CCs, BCCs,
or other information. Now let's create a
brand new email message by clicking on the
new email icon in the bottom right corner. Notice that the new
message icon is in the bottom right
corner on every one of the mail screens. So whether you're
inside of a message. Inside of your inbox or
in your mailbox view, you can always easily
start a new message. Let's go ahead
and click it. From the new message
view up at the top we can address our email. You can do this by typing
a couple of letters and it will look inside
of your address book. But if you don't know
who you want to send it to or you want to send
it to an entire group, click the plus button
on the right side which will open up your whole
address book allowing you access to any of
your address book groups or any of the people
in your address book. Simply clicking
on anyone's name will add them right
into this email. Down below that we've got
the CC and BCC section. Clicking right here will
open up this section where you can carbon
copy or blind carbon copy anyone from this email. And down below we've
got the From section. If you've got multiple
email accounts on your phone, this is where you
can come and click on the email address to choose
a different email to send this message from. It will default to
whatever your default email account is. And if you're not sure
what that is, head over to Settings, Go down to
the bottom where it says apps and open up mail
and check and see what your default account is. The default account should
be set to whichever email address you use the most. Moving down below
that we've got our subject section where
we can easily type in a subject line. I strongly encourage you
to never send an email without putting a subject
line in first because it will just immediately
get flagged as spam. And here's another
pro tip for you. If you look over to the
right side of the subject line, you'll notice
this little alarm bell. Clicking on that will
turn on the notification capability for this
message, meaning if anyone responds or replies to
this message, you will be alerted immediately so you
don't miss any updates. And now that we've got
all our information filled out, we're ready
to send this email. But I'm not going
to do that yet. Let's just hold
off for a moment. If you got great value
from this video, learn something new or had
an aha moment, give this video a thumbs up. That just makes it so
much easier for other people to find this video. And if you've got a
question, a comment, something you want
more information about, something you
want less information about, Drop it down in
the comment section. I love to hear
from you guys. And there's a little
legend that I've heard. Every time someone
subscribes, a spinning beach ball gets its wings. So go ahead and hit
that subscribe button. So you never miss
any of my new videos. And maybe that beach
ball will leave you alone for a few minutes. Now with that said, let's
hop into the power Tip.. So now that we've done
all this amazing work, learning how to use
the mail app, learning how to categorize our
emails, learning about prioritizations and all
sorts of other functions, we've gone ahead and
built this email. But sometimes, You're not
ready to send it right away, so you need to
be able to put an email into the drafts section,
and there's two really powerful ways to do that. The first one is by
clicking the cancel button in the upper
left hand corner here. That will give you
the option to either delete this message
or save the draft. But, where do drafts
go when you save them? We'll talk about that
in just a moment. There's a better
way to do it. Let's click the
cancel button. Sometimes you've been
working on an email and you're almost ready to
send it, but you need to grab some additional
information or look something up or email
someone else before you fully send it. It's really easy to save
a message as a draft and come back to it later
by grabbing this little notch at the top of the
email and just dragging it all the way to the
bottom of the screen. When you do that, it
will dock it down at the bottom of the screen
underneath your mail app. Now, you can go about
and do anything else you want to do with mail. You can create new
messages, you can do anything you want to do,
and that email will stay docked at the bottom of
your mail app until you're ready to get back to it
by simply tapping it. But there's even one
more power tip I want to give you before we
finish up this video. Let's click cancel on
this and let's click where it says save draft. Now many people know
that if you click the back arrow in the upper
left hand corner, you can find your drafts folder
in your favorites list. But that's not the
easiest way to do it. There's a much
easier way to do it. from right inside
the inbox view. By pressing and holding
on your new message icon in the bottom right
hand corner, it will automatically pop up
all of your previous drafts, making it easy
for you to get back to any message, no matter
how long ago you wrote it. So that's what we've
got for today's video all about Apple Mail's
new iOS 18 update. Hope you learned something
new and got great value out of it, but
remember there's always something more to learn. Check out this video to
learn even more about how to use your Apple products
to become more productive and more organized. I'm Dylan Stewart
and I will see you in the comments.",{}
