Nahin marna ganwaara pyaar
Mein tum se ye kehana hai
Tumhe bhi zinda rehana hai
Mujhe bhi zinda rehana hai

Kabhi aasaan kabhi mushkil
Ajab hai pyaar ki raahe
Kabhi aasaan kabhi mushkil
Ajab hai pyaar ki raahe
Magar jo pyaar karate hain
Kabhi bharate nahin aahen
Hawaao ne ye kaha
Fizaao ne ye kaha
Aai pyaar ki ye rrut badi
Tufaani tu darna na o meri rani
Badalega ye mausam ari deewaani
Ham likhenge prem kahani
Kabhi aasaan kabhi mushkil
Ajab hai pyaar ki raahe
Kabhi aasaan kabhi mushkil
Ajab hai pyaar ki raahe
Magar jo pyaar karate hain

Kabhi bharate nahin aahen
Hawaao ne ye kaha
Fizaao ne ye kaha
Aai pyaar ki ye rrut badi
Tufaani tu darna na o meri rani
Badalega ye mausam ari deewaani
Ham likhenge prem kahani

Gardish me hi sahi ye
Sitaare hamnashin
Gardish me hi sahi ye
Sitaare hamnashin
Dhoondhegi kal hame ye
Bahaare hamnashin
Imtehaan pyaar
Ke roz hote nahin
Pyaar waale kabhi
Sabr khote nahi
Mohabbat ho hi jaati hai
Mohabbat ki nahi jaati
Ye aisi chiz hai jo sabake
Hisse me nahi aati

@LadyGaga 



(Lyrics):
[Intro: Lady Gaga]
(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars]
Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only one worth fighting for

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars]
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga]
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

[Bridge: Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga & Both]
Right next to you
Next to you
Right next to you
Oh-oh
[Chorus: Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars, Bruno Mars]
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

[Outro: Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars]
(Ooh, ooh)
I'd wanna be next to you

Video Transcript:

I love I you.

now before you laugh or make fun of me, or just think I'm weird,

let me tell you what I mean by that first.

I don’t mean it in some fake, warm and fuzzy, sentimental kind of way. 

And I’m not saying it just to be nice, or to look good, or to get you to like me. 

What I mean is, at the very least, I only want what is good for you. 

At the very most, I mean, i'll give myself, my life, in any way I can, for your good.

And I don’t care how I feel, or how I look, or what Im getting out of it, 

or if I feel like it or not.

Love doesn't go this way.  

Only this way. 

And who are you?

Well you could be anyone.

my friend, my family, my spouse, person I like. 

well thats easy, anyone can love the people they like.   

What about the person I don't like, the person who doesn't like me, the person nobody likes,

what about the person I totally disagree with, the person who's completely different from me, there person I want to hate, the person everyone hates, the person who repulses me.

DOESN'T matter.

Love doesn't pick and choose who to love, just like the sun doesn’t pick and choose who to shine on, it just shines.

And what is your good?

Well it's all those little things that are gonna help us find the one thing that we all want, that we’re all searching for, 

happiness.

as much as we can find here in this life, but more importantly, the full happiness that we can only find in the next life.

and I'll love you no matter what you do, 

but that doesn't mean I’m going to love everything you do. 

Love has to be tough, sometimes even fierce.

If you do anything that's gonna harm, impede, poison, delay or divert your good, 

or the good of anyone else's, 

I have to stand against it, not you.

Even if it's awkward, even if it's unpopular, even if it's gonna turn you against me, 

for a little while. 

But even when love is tough,  

Love is always patient. 

That's why we have a whole lifetime. 

love is always gentle, kind, tender, loving, 

never pushy, preachy, pointing fingers, rigid or mean.

and I don’t care what you’ve done, or how big you've screwed up, or how vast our differences are, or if your life is a giant, global sized disaster.  

love is bigger than all these things.  

And I don't care how worthless, or flawed, or unlovable, or insignificant, you think you may be.  

love breaks through all these.  

and if you get hurt, which we do, 

or get into trouble, which we do, 

or get beat up by the world, which we will.  

and you're tired, and angry, and bitter, and miserable, and scared, LIKE THE REST OF US, 

and feel like you’re, drifting all alone in a sea of, suffering… 

ill suffer with you.  

and if we disagree and get into those epic fights, which we will, 

and even if you betray me, and laugh at me, and make me look stupid, 

and walk away a thousand times,

Ill forgive you, a million times,

because nothing that could ever happen in this tiny little universe, 

could ever be more important to me than you.  

Not even myself.  

This is what I mean when I say I love you…

but this is not my love…

my love is weak, and self-centered at best.  

this is his love.  

and he said, he commanded, 

go out there and love one another as I loved you.

so I'll say it say again even though I know i'm gonna fail at it a million times today.

Lana Del Rey - Love (Lyrics)

Look at you, kids, with your vintage music
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusin'

It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes it's enough just to make you feel crazy

You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

Look at you, kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues, but
That don't mean that you should abuse it

Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

But you get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
It don't matter because it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby

And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy

I get ready, I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
It doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love, ah, ah
I'm young and in love, ah, ah, ah, ah

Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm

Sagittarius let's see what do we have for [Applause] [Music] you so we have I I have to let go I have to let you go to find myself I'm going crazy without you I want to see you so bad my f my finances are a mess I've made bad decisions I am in the process of turning things [Music] around this was a hard lesson I needed to learn I was out of control I need to figure myself out it's interesting because it's very similar energy isn't it I have to let you go to find myself I need to figure out myself out so you have someone here Sagittarius [Music] who who is complicating things a lot I feel the reason why they are complicating things and they might be a mess is because for some of you this person indeed created some sort of situations and they made a bad decisions financial decisions and they don't know what to do they don't know how to handle it and that really affected this whole situation they are missing you though if there is no contact situation this person is claiming here that they really want to see you very badly and it's like yeah they subconscious is saying here Sagittarius it was a lesson it was a hard lesson I needed to learn yeah I feel this person maybe I'm getting here that you might be dealing with someone who's convinced that they know best they made a decision that really was quite devastating for them irresp if it was financial decision or whatever decision that might be but it really really impacted I feel this person's life and also uh romantic life meaning disconnection mhm I feel this person is now trying to figure not themselves but it's like they trying to figure out they they are trying to figure out this whole situation you know trying to figure out things but this is someone who complicates stuff and there is no need for them to do that let's see could you please show me this person's energy and feelings towards Sagittarius and this connection please Queen of Pentacles uh Temperance Knight of Cups 10 of Swords mhm seven of Swords five of Wands the emperor the hangedman and Eight of Cups there is something think about this person being unable to handle what they've created and I feel it took a kind of a tool on you if I can say it that way what I mean by this I feel that this person kind of projected all this frustration that they had onto you 10 of Swords suggests here that with the seven of swords for some yeah for some of you this is someone who got uh played essentially someone promised them something it didn't deliver they didn't deliver and five of Wands this person obviously got very frustrated angry they didn't know how to handle it yeah but indeed something here ended and it also affect fected this connection we have this is a Queen of Pentacles okay Temperance and Knight of Cups I feel this person feel a little bit foolish because I'm seeing you telling them think twice do you think it's a good idea and it's like they didn't listen I feel that you were the one saying listen take your time think about this there is no need to rush yeah I'm seeing you saying this Temperance is your energy Sagittarius and I feel that you've tried to be very kind of grounded very supportive very kind I feel that your delivery was very kind to them but this is someone who refused to listen and this is where we are at the moment or to be more precise they are we have the EMP the hman and Eight of Cups yeah I'm seeing this person now completely seeing things from a different perspective this Emperor is seeing things differently M Eight of Cups there is something here about I feel that whatever here happened in their life it triggered them to walked away from something or many things that just didn't make them happy it's like this person is decluttering emotions that's what I am getting Sagittarius you might be dealing with Pisces we have your energy so you might be dealing with another Sagittarius and we also have Aries excuse me let's see could you please show me sagittarius's energy and feelings towards this person and this connection please we have two of Cups love king of cups I think that was let's see your energy towards this person in this connection Sagittarius Three of Swords nine of Pentacles Queen of Wands Ace of Pentacles The Chariot and the tower they really broke your heart King Of Wands and kn eight of Swords okay eight of Pentacles yeah I feel you know I'm getting here Sagittarius that you are that for a lot of you you might be heartbroken you know over over what happened between the two of you with the nine of Pentacles I feel that you're trying to focus on yourself trying to focus on things that makes you happy but three of ss you know with the nine of Pentacles suggests here that this person made a selfish decision and the repr cussions of their actions really really impacted this connection we have this Queen of Wands but we have King Of Wands I feel that there is enormous attraction between the two of you chemistry might be very intense and you might see this person as a match but at the moment I feel that you are heartbroken also it's like I feel that you are heartbroken over the fact that this person at some point prioritize something else over this connection you know and I feel that there was a moment there was a time when you saw this connection as an opportunity um for progress in a sense of I feel that you kind of you I'm getting oh gosh I wanted to say it properly it's like I feel that there was at some there was a moment when you felt that it's like what you wanted was within the rich of your hand you know with this Ace of Pentacles and you felt like finally things will move on now will I will see progress with the Chariot but something here happened with the tower and it stopped that progress something unexpected something out of the blue and it changed things it changed things drastically mhm so we have King Of Wands Knight of Swords with the the eight of Pentacles I'm getting here based on your energy that this is someone who will have to really prove it to you that they care that they willing to to work on the situation that they want that they really want to work things out with you you know that they really want to put an effort and they really need to try with the Knight of Swords and eight of Pentacles they charm will get them so far at this stage of this connection I feel that it's that is how you see the situation Sagittarius you might be dealing with um we have strong fire uh energy so another Sagittarius right Aries Leo we have Scorpio let's see the outcome could you please show me the outcome [Music] we have Page of Cups King of Swords king of Cups ace of cups eight of Wands Wheel of Fortune and four of cups The Hermit the lovers and the two of swords as an overall energy for this reading I feel that the love is still there between the two of you I feel this person has love for you I feel that you have love for them with the lovers at the moment both of you might be in a Hermit mode trying to figure out things um and with the two of Swords it feels like there is a stalemate because of what happened mhm so we have page of cups cups King of Swords and king of cups I see this person actually reaching out to you Sagittarius and expressing their feelings for you mhm Page of Cups King of Swords that's communication of affection and king of Cups expressing feelings this person has love for you they want to tell you about they want to share it with you that they have this love for you it's like they want to reassure you Ace of cups is a bonding energy there will be an opportunity for a new beginning for a new beginning in love with this person I see this person coming here with an offer of love and peace you know they for some of you this is someone who will apologize and we have eight of Wands The Wheel of Fortune and four of cups things will change for some of you if there is a physical distance between the two of you um I see this person taking action and eight of Wands it's a very action orientated card will of Fortune put things into motion however we have a four of cups I'm not seeing you 100% satisfied it's like I feel that um this person will be in touch with you and things going to change for the better but for you it might be a case that it's not good enough you know everything is subjective right for someone that might be good enough but for the other person it might not be good enough and that's the thing and I feel with the four of cups you might feel like well I appreciate the effort I appreciate you wanting to bring a change to the situation but it's like you need to try it harder it can be as simple as that but there will be a change there will be a change of course it will depend on you Sagittarius if the if this change it's just the beginning uh and if you want to you know invest more in this beginning or if it's just simply not good enough okay so you might be dealing with Aquarius taus Scorpio Leo we have Virgo we have Gemini yeah and your energy actually is Sagittarius so we have more of your energy Sagittarius therefore you might be dealing with another Sagittarius crosswatchers the roles can be reversed Sagittarius I will leave it here thank you so so very much for being with me please like share and subscribe and once again thank you very much for your time I truly truly appreciate you Sagittarius have a fantastic and absolutely gorgeous day and once again thank you very very much for being with me I am sending you much much love till next time take care

itself you don't want to go through that emotional upheaval yeah because I feel that it took you quite some time to get over a certain one a specific one but at the same time I feel that you cannot help how you feel about this person and with the sun I feel that this person makes you feel happy but but there is something here about you being also quiet guarded because you don't fully trust this person it's like you might be seeing them a little bit wishy-washy or they are not sharing much about their past and it's like I feel that you are more concerned here about their intentions it's like you don't fully trust this person it's like is this person is for the right reasons with me or in my life I feel that's the case but I'm seeing you giving it a time and there is something here for some of you might feel like time will tell time always tell that's how it's been always mhm we have King Of Wands we have eight of swords and nine of Swords yeah I feel this is this this this feeling of uncertainty uncertainty it's seriously playing on your [Music] mind I feel that you're thinking a lot about this person but there is something here about something is stressing you out I feel Leo

trickster they are not fully transparent again with you it's like they're hiding they might be having Secrets I feel that you you just don't trust their motives Justice with the four of Wands but there is a just such strong it's just odd this this Dynamic is very very strange because is it's like you don't I feel that you don't trust them they don't know how you feel about them they don't they have abandonment issues they cannot let go of you but at the same time they want best for you oh my gosh it's 10 of Wands as a bonding energy here this card is showing it's tiring it's draining it's exhausting and it's a hard work this connection and yeah I feel that they have serious intentions but it's like there is some sort of kind of energy of I feel that this is you feeling not sure about this person's intentions yes I will leave it there because I'm repeating myself we have seven of Swords two of Cups and Knight of Swords you're dealing here with someone who's very strategic and I feel that they are like this because the circumstances in their life in their life forc them to be um I'm seeing this person wanting very much to be with you I'm seeing them chasing you and this connection and the Seven of Swords here it's it's more about this person's um tactics in order to be with you they don't want you to let go of them they don't want you to walk away and I feel this person can manipulate circumstances situations in order for you to stay with them because they want this connection very very much and this is where I was getting that kind of trickster energy but it's it's more than that it's not that surface level it's it's more complex than this because I'm seeing someone who seriously cares a lot about you they want to be with you and they are ready to kind of to use manipulation in order to have the reassurance that you will not walked away that's what I am getting here Leo then we have four of cups 10 of Cups and the lovers I see relationship you know I see a relationship I see love between the two of you but this four of cups it's showing me that there will be aspects or there will be something here you that you might not feel that optimistic about with the four of cups it's like something it's not working and it's like love is there connection is there but something brings the satisfaction and I believe that you know best what that might be based on your circumstances it's like we can have this 10 of Cups and the lovers which is beautiful it's just loving happy relationship and yet there is the four of cups something it's kind of not working 100% as it should for this connection and if you resonate with this reading irrespective if I mention you sign of zodiac or not or not but if you resonate with this reading that's your message obviously but you know exactly what that is that's what they telling me and I feel with the lovers you will have to make a decision with regards to the future of this connection Leo it doesn't have to be you know in a near future immediate future but um I feel this is a very complex relationship very complex very very complex but I'm seeing you being you know spending really nice time together with the lovers and 10 of Cups full of love and and and closeness you know very very [Music] beautiful Leo you might be dealing with Virgo Gemini uh Libra mhm yes Libra crosswatchers of course the roles can be reverse Leo I will leave it here thank you so so very much for being with me please like share and subscribe and once again thank you very much for your time I truly truly appreciate you Leo have a fantastic and absolutely gorgeous day and once again thank you very much for being with me I am sending you much much love till next time take care bye,{}

Thank you Justine & Michael 💚

Back in December 2022, we released a film featuring Antony and Margie, who shared with us some of their views on love and relationships. If you haven't seen this first film, you can watch it here - https://youtu.be/pbyQhbZJhwI

Following the overwhelming response to our initial video, we've received many messages asking for further glimpses into the lives of this fabulous couple. Your voices have been heard, and so we recently visited with them again. During our latest encounter, Antony and Margie chat more about the various stages of married life, and some of their secrets to a successful marriage. Their reflections are sure to resonate deeply with those of you who are seeking guidance on matters of the heart.

“An outstanding love doesn’t come from two half-fulfilled people coming together to make one whole, complete life. Outstanding love comes from two whole people coming together to share and enhance their already full and beautiful lives.” ~Pia Scade

Filmed in Colesburg, South Africa. 
Featuring Antony and Margie Osler (https://www.stoepzen.co.za/accommodation.html)

What is love Antony?  What is love? This is about as good as it gets. And it seems to get better as we get older. But there will probably be a tipping point where we don’t know what’s going to happen and we’ll just have to be willing to slide together down some slippery slope. When we got married we worked out a series of vows which we wrote out and we said to each other. I can’t really remember what they were except that it was something like that we hope one day we will sit here in our old age still together and just enjoy this life that we’ve been given. Maybe we do need to renew our vows so that we remember what we said. But the one that stands out quite strongly which I feel we’re embodying now is, ‘May our home be a place where people can accept themselves.’ Which, when we drew that up, was a beautiful intention and I feel like we’re really living that. The other was that we don’t hide behind each other. That we have our own identity and are at one with ourselves. That we’re not hiding behind another person or expecting them to fulfil what is important to us. What is often hard to accept when you live so much inside yourself is that the person in front of you is very different to you. I think in a marriage that’s the hardest thing... to realise that some of the differences that you fell in love with in the beginning are the things that bug you later. I’ve seen that in myself and with others. So those are the little daily things that need to be communicated and sat down and made a compromise.  I see that if I leave the butter out after I make toast that my wife is furious... daily. Then I think the one way I can show a commitment to the relationship is to either not have toast at all, or to have toast without butter, or to put the butter away. And I don’t have to talk to her about it, I don’t have to be analytical about it, you know, one picks it up. And of course there are things I do that will infuriate her  that I don’t pick up. She’ll tell me... she’s not scared of me in that way. If I look back, there are stages in a married life. There’s the initial excitement of being together. And then of course the utter astonishment of having children. That was just wonderful, beyond measure. Sometimes it was really hard work. We had to earn a living. I had to travel to work. There were times we had to be apart, times we came together. And we didn’t resist it or complain... we just did it. And in retrospect that doing of it was a wonderful cementing of the relationship. Since then I’ve stopped travelling. We spend all our time together now, pretty much. We sleep together, we eat together, we drink together. And it’s wonderful and there’s a whole new adjustment that happens. And I think that’s really precious. People talk about it’s difficult when your children leave home... of course our children have left home long ago... but for us it’s been wonderful. We’ve had time on our own and we make as much use of it as we can. I think it’s very important to find something when your children leave home, that the two of you do together that is meaningful and nourishing to both of you. When I look around at my family and my friends, that’s often when couples go different ways. Then one feels that you’re living two separate lives. And it’s very difficult to find a place of connection because your priorities have been work, or children, or both. And now none of those are something that you share anymore. I never give advice... I wouldn’t take it anyway. But for us, what’s really helped was having, as Margie says, not only a common direction in our life but a sense that we actually deliberately do things together that are meaningful to us. Every night we gather around sunset and we watch the sun go down. In a sense, ritual in that way was always a part of our life. So we always have watched the sun go down. It was always important for us. And when the children were younger they would join us. And now that they’re not here we sit together and we talk about them all the time. Not all the time darling. But it’s quite a deliberate, ritualised part of the day. So we make it precious, I think that’s what we try and do. And it does become precious. Not so much because we set out to make something precious but we decided how we wanted to spend that time together. And it turned out to be precious, which is wonderful. I feel quite strongly, growing older, that however much I look back to a more romantic postcard version of what life could be that something fantastically, wonderfully ordinary has taken its place. Ordinary is extraordinary. If you think of your life, it’s the little things, the ordinary little things, that are very meaningful and you don’t forget them. Little kindnesses, little actions  that you don’t expect to happen, are the ordinary. And I think one of the most ordinary things that we humans are made to do is to be present and listen to each other. And I think it’s only when we stop that we see the extraordinary in the ordinary, when we really stop and feel and hear. In the same way that the leaves change in spring and fall in autumn and that certain birds appear at certain times of the year and the sun comes and the wind goes... all of that is part of my life. And she is absolutely, intimately as much a part of it as all of that. I live in the veld (nature) and my wife. That’s how it feels. I’m so pleased you live in me. I’d like to think that she feels something of the same. There’s a sense of almost the inevitability of looking around and finding you here next to me in the same way that I lift the blind in the morning  and see the sun come up. That has been a discovery for me that I did not anticipate. And I wish it for everybody. And I think if one gives oneself a chance it will appear all by itself. If I look over one day and she’s not there, it will be heartbreaking. That’s absolutely true. I will then as best I can honour the life that we’ve had together. She is my life and my life will continue. Saying ‘she is my life’ doesn’t mean that I have no life without her. Saying ‘she is my life’ means that when she’s with me, it’s full of her. It means that when she dies and I’m still around that my life will consist of whatever there is around me. And that almost my duty to her would be to live that life as best as I can. As she mentioned, we undertook not to hide behind each other, that I only live through you. I live through you, but that’s just the beginning, it’s not the end. So that when you die I’ll weep, I’ll build you a fantastic grave overlooking the hills, and we’ll have sirens and choirs of angels all over the place. And then I’ll play music with the angels. That’s how it feels to me. And I’m not looking forward to it. It sounds like you are... the choir of angels. Shall I bring them on now? I think the way I would honour her would be to get on with the life that is left for me. That’s what she would wish for me, more than anything. She would want me to see the sun come up, to dig in the garden, to look after visitors, to make the bed properly at last. But I think that she would trust me that however sad it was that sadness would become my life and would be manure for whatever last days are left which are probably not going to be very many. But that would be a huge event for me. I’ve got a little poem that I’d like to recite if I may? I’ll try and remember it. I shaved my head for the children of Palestine. I swept up the leaves in the Jewish cemetery. My wife wrapped presents for the old ladies in the frail care home. My daughter washed the dishes after lunch. The Buddha of Compassion has 84 000 hands. Which of those are yours?",{}

Lyrics

Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
For a moment, there it goes
Turn around, next thing you know
Love is back

Oh, my God, I feel so bored
I'm startin' to realise that all the boys that I find
Are all trouble, I told my mother
She said, ""Girl, get your glass full""
So I did and I saw

You
I saw you gleaming across the scene, across the room
It's all in you
I need the meaning when I see it all in you

Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
For a moment, there it goes
Turn around, next thing you know
Love is back

Hallelujah, it's nice to know you
It's so peculiar how you've come and changed my mind
I'll fall head first, I hope it doesn't hurt
What's your preference? 'Cause I know mine

And it's you
Foolish of me to say these things, but I want to
I know it's all in you
Don't need a reason when I see it all in you

Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
For a moment, there it goes
Turn around, next thing you know
Love is back

Might be foolish or out my mind
Must've said it a thousand times
Can't be lyin' if I see the truth
I know who and I look at you
Might be too young to realise
If there's a mountain, I should've climbed it

But love
Love is back
Love is back
Good thing I know, I know love is back
And I know that love is back
Love is back
Love is back, mm-mm-mm
Love is back, oh, yeah
Love is back
Love is back

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnRBEspHvCw,A Homeless Girl’s Love Made Me Rich | @LoveBusterShow,"Are you afraid of falling in love? 

Christian noticed someone hiding under a table at a restaurant. He peaked beneath the tablecloth to see a girl curled up in there. At this moment, his fiance showed up. She asked him what he was doing, and before he could answer, the mysterious girl kissed him. He pushed her away and got up: “I was looking for this”, Chris said while showing his fiance a gorgeous wedding ring. The woman smiled: “I would say yes if you weren’t hiding a mistress under this table”. She walked away, and Chris was left alone and confused. He turned to the girl and asked: “Why did you do that? She loved me”. The girl was creepily calm: “Then why did she steal your ring?”.
Chris looked inside the velvet box and realized the jewel was indeed gone. 

He rushed after his fiance… and saw her at a pawn shop, selling the ring. Chris was heartbroken. He collapsed on the floor, weakened by the pain. But the mysterious girl showed up once more: “I’m sorry. It’s all my fault. And I’m going to fix it”.

Venus Taurus in this reading we'll be focusing on your new person or your current connection let's see Taurus let's see Sun Moon Rising and Venus Bond selfishness divorce ego O Okay so Taurus um um you are dealing here with someone who has big ego big big ego it feels like you sh very strong bond with this person okay but this is someone here who who's been quite selfish and I feel that at some point ego got better of them and you might feel like something ended between the two of you energetically what the fact that we have this reading about this person it feels like it it it hasn't really you know you might had falling out or there was an argument or disagreement or this person created tension and it's like you are not on the speaking terms at the moment but yeah I feel this person said something they did it was selfish uh and it created some sort of kind of distance between the two of you distance emotional distance at the moment let's see could you please show me more we have King of Swords Six of Pentacles Two of Pentacles Knight of Wands Ace of Pentacles and Justice with the four of Swords the death card and six of cups yeah yeah it's not over Taurus at the moment there might be no contact situation or it's like there's a silence between the two of you that's going to change it yeah it's like it will come to an end because we have the death cut and look what we have the following card here there is this six of Cups re this person wants to reconnect reconcile yeah they want to come back or at least talk about about the situation but for me this is more about um they want reconciliation with you yeah things going to change things going to change we have King of Swords Six of Pentacles Two of Pentacles Ace of Wands Ace of why Ace of Wands Knight of Wands excuse me Ace of Pentacles and Justice yeah this person here will will come forward they feel it's a solid offer okay it's their perspective I feel this person will offer some sort of kind of explanation this person will offer uh to make things right with you or it's like let's bring peace to the situation with the Justice mhm is it a solid offer well it's coming from the Knight of Wands it's coming from a very inconsistent energy I feel this person has been quite in and out hot and cold with you they brought a certain amount of uncertainty and they've been very inconsistent so for some of you might be feeling like well I don't know if this person can be taken seriously therefore if their offer can be taken seriously but they will make a move towards you we have King of Swords Six of Pentacles and two of pentac there is something here Taurus about this person telling you something else and then they changing their mind or it's like changing um the scenario uh let's say it's an example let's say they said something like yeah um last Saturday I went to spend some time with my uh with my grandmother right and then you've asked them let's say next week the other day and they said that they went um to meet up with their friends or something like this you know that's what I am getting it's like change of scenario with the Two of Pentacles Six of Pentacles and the King of Swords and also Taurus what I am getting here that you are dealing with someone who likes to be in control very autocratic kind of energy it's like what I am saying is right and you should just accept this a little bit of an attitude I'm getting here quite a big ego indeed I feel this person has problems to listen it's like they don't listen and I feel that you have a lot to say you might be dealing Taurus with Aquarius we have Libra we have Scorpio let's see could you please show me this person's feelings you might be seeing 1111 a lot for of Wands you might be dealing with your twinflame doesn't have to be the case but for some of you might feel that way about this person let's see could you please show me this person's feelings towards Taurus three of Pentacles wanting to work with you [Music] the devil card two of Swords king of Pentacles stubbor starborn person Taurus Knight of Swords six of Wands and the Seven of [Music] Swords full of Pride six of Wands convinced that they know best Knight of Swords seven of Swords yeah this person has some explaining to do the thing is here Taurus that this person is convinced that you will believe them seven of Swords here suggests that they are very strategic this individual but also it feels like they were they they were hiding something it's like they weren't fully transparent with you and I feel that they got caught by you it's like something didn't make sense it didn't add up we have the devil card two of swords with the king of Pentacles in their feelings I will say it Taurus I feel this person is in denial this is someone who uh feels that you know they are okay everything is fine but the reality is that they need to change the devil card here suggests that they are bringing something toxic on emotional level you know I feel this person can be quite emotionally manipul ctive um I feel that they doing it because it's like they creating some sort of protection for themselves I feel this person is quite guarded with regards to their heart it's like they don't want to get emotionally hurt they don't they don't want their heart to be broken therefore they are protecting their heart here with the two of Swords but I'm seeing someone who is very stubborn and it's very difficult for them to admit that they made a mistake or they are in a wrong [Music] mhm I feel Taurus that this person is actually qu a little bit obsessing over you with this with the devil energy with the devil card excuse me you didn't care with someone who likes to be in control Taurus they do they want to have the last World word and I feel this person actually stuck on you you know with the devil card and two of Swords emotionally that's why we had six of Cups CU they are coming back you might be dealing with Capricorn that's right Capricorn let's see could you please show me this how this person sees this whole situation we have Knight of Cups 10 of Cups Queen of Swords the moon with five of Wands the Tower and the high priestess there is something here about this person knowing that they need to tell you the truth they they need to stop it's like exposure because High Priestess is holding a secret it's unknown the tower it's a destruction of some sort of kind of um Foundation here and five of Wands it's conflict yeah I for some of you there was like a passionate exchange of views and this I feel that you you caught this person of not telling you the full truth and being not fully transparent with you it's like they got exposed for the for their um secrets we have Knight of Cups 10 of Cups Queen of Swords s and the moon well this person here will be very nice Taurus they they're coming for some of you this is someone who um will Express that they want to be with you you know that you are they happy ever after they might even give you a token of affection or gift um Queen of Swords and the moon it's like they want you to heal them out they like to talk but this person um with the moon card I'm not seeing here to be honest with you Taurus them clarifying things with you it's like I don't know they will be Charming it's like this person feels that they can get away with it they feel it's a solid offer you know that they're going to make things right with you but it's coming from this Knight of Wands that over and it's a very in and out hot and cold and kind of unpredictable energy Taurus you might be dealing with Gemini we have Pisces cancerian energy with the moon Scorpio Aries moreon Pisces could you please show me the outcome The Chariot King Of Wands eight of Wands okay seven of Wands that cards wanted to come out okay the temperance judgment And The Fool yeah yeah judgment they want to resurrect rekindle something with you as an overall energy for your reading Taurus Temperance they want to bring more kind of you know Harmony to the situation it's like let's have a quiet conversation that's what I am getting the full they want to start over that's why I was getting here it's not over between the two of you far from it we have the Chariot King Of Wands eight of Wands seven of Wands it's like there is I feel you're dealing here with someone who is a very um they might have a quick temper or it's like they are very passionate with this with all this wands energy but at the same time it's like this person trying to be in control what they saying to you I feel however I feel that at this time they didn't pay attention what they were saying and you caught them there is still something here about this person when it comes to communication with the seven of Wands it's like but I but I haven't done that or it's like they are pushing away some sort of something that is going to be discussed it's like they are not admitting it that's what I am getting here from eight of Wands with the seven of Wands The Chariot suggest here that this person will take action towards you but that communication it's still this person will try to deflect I feel Taurus that's what's going to happen but you will hear from them you will hear from this person you might be dealing with Sagittarius we have more Aquarius Aries uh Scorpio cancerian energy with the Chariot Taurus if I haven't mentioned a person sign of zodiac but you resonate with this message that's your reading crosswatch as the roles can be revers Taurus I will leave it here thank you so so

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5i3QRvPA9Y,Paul Partohap - P.S. I LOVE YOU (Lyric Video),"(VERSE)
The only place I call home, you are
Every hope and dream I've ever had, you are
In other lifetimes, without any doubt
I'll keep choosing you

Like a cool breeze on a summer day, you are
Like a brightest star up in the sky, girl you shine
Keep making me wanting more
Girl, you are what I am lookin' for

(CHORUS)
I love you (love you oh)
I love you in every universe
You'll always be the first
Love you, you're my only one

I love you (I love you)
Love you still, I always will
I want you to know how I feel (how I feel)
And all the promise that I'll fulfill 

(My only one, my only love)

Lyrics:
Dil Ibaadat Kar Raha Hai, Dhadkane Meri Sun
Tujhko Main Kar Lu Haasil Lagi Hai Yahi Dhun
Jindagi Ki Shaak Se Lu Kuchh Hasin Pal Main Chun
Tujhko Main Kar Lu Haasil Lagi Hai Yahi Dhun

Dil Ibaadat Kar Raha Hai, Dhadkane Meri Sun
Tujhko Main Kar Lu Haasil Lagi Hai Yahi Dhun
Jindagi Ki Shaak Se Lu Kuchh Hasin Pal Main Chun
Tujhko Main Kar Lu Haasil Lagi Hai Yahi Dhun

Jo Bhi Jitne Pal Jiu, Unhe Tere Sang Jiu
Jo Bhi Kal Ho Abb Mera Use Tere Sang Jiu
Jo Bhi Saanse Main Bharu Unhe Tere Sang Bharu
Chaahe Jo Ho Raasta Use Tere Sang Chalu
Dil Ibaadat Kar Raha Hai, Dhadkane Meri Sun
Tujhko Main Kar Lu Haasil Lagi Hai Yahi Dhun

Mujhko De Tu Mit Jaane Abb Khud Se Dil Mil Jaane
Kyun Hai Ye Itna Faasala
Lamahe Yeh Phir Na Aane Inko Tu Na De Jaane
Tu Mujhpe Khud Ko De Luta
Tujhe Tujhse Tod Lu Kahi Khud Se Jod Lu
Meri Jismo Jaan Pe Aa Teri Khushbu Odh Lu
Jo Bhi Saanse Main Bharu Unhe Tere Sang Bharu
Chaahe Jo Ho Raasta Use Tere Sang Chalu
Dil Ibaadat Kar Raha Hai Dhadkane Meri Sun
Tujhko Main Kar Lu Haasil Lagi Hai Yahi Dhun

Baaho Me De Bas Jaane Sine Me De Chhup Jaane
Tujh Bin Main Jaau Toh Kaha
Tujhse Hai Mujhko Paane Yaado Ke Woh Najraane
Ik Jinpe Hak Ho Bas Mera
Teri Yaado Me Rahu Tere Khwaabo Me Jagu
Mujhe Dhundhe Jab Koyi Teri Aankho Me Milu
Jo Bhi Saanse Main Bharu Unhe Tere Sang Bharu
Chaahe Jo Ho Raasta Use Tere Sang Chalu
Dil Ibaadat Kar Raha Hai, Dhadkane Meri Sun
Tujhko Main Kar Lu Haasil Lagi Hai Yahi Dhun

Billy Ward is a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) and has been practicing in for the past 13 years in the New York City Suburbs of New Jersey. In addition to having a private practice, he has also been counseling students at Seton Hall Prep High School since 1998.  Currently he is the director of retreats for the school and also teaches a senior course for Human Development and Theology.

Billy is a graduate from Georgetown University where he studied Psychology.  He was also the quarterback of the football team for four years.  He had a short stint with the Baltimore Ravens in 1999, which was a great experience and personal achievement.  He continues to credit his athletic experiences with helping him to understand the mind-body connection and the ability to set a life goal with great determination and tenacity. After leaving Baltimore he continued his study of psychology at Seton Hall University where he attained his Masters Degree and Post Masters Degree.

Reviewer: Ariana Bleau Lugo Here's the deal: Life is really all about love. I'm not just saying that
because I'm a father of a newborn baby; I'm saying that because
as a teacher and as a therapist I've seen people basically
choose between two things: love or something else. What I've witnessed
and experienced is this: When people choose love, they always choose right. I was asked to speak today
on the topic of illumination, and it made me think about the way
the light inside us all can shine. My favorite way is through our love which can illuminate in our relationships. The most important relationship
that we'll ever have, is the relationship
that we have with ourselves. And next comes the relationships
that we share with one another. As simply as I can put it, we are here, on this very Earth,
to love and to be loved - and love is light. In a second, what I'd like 
to do with you today, is a brief, relaxing, 
guided-imagery exercise, where I'm going to have you
close your eyes and consider three expressions of light
that can return us to love. I'm going to have you close your eyes
and consider three items, and then associate each item
with a person in your life. So, let's get ready. Can I ask you to put
your feet flat on the floor, palms facing up in your lap, and when you're ready, gently allow your upper eyelids
to meet your lower eyelashes. Close your eyes 
and let's everyone take a deep breath. Relax your shoulders. The first item I'd like you
to picture is the sun. Picture the sun in the big, blue sky,
feel the warmth of her rays, and consider how the sun
continues to show up every day, sharing its light and energy
unconditionally, even on a cold February morning. Is there somebody in your life
that reminds you of the sun? Somebody that loves you unconditionally? Picture that person now
and feel their love. The next item I'd like you
to picture is a lighthouse. See the light emanating
from the top of the structure at the ocean's edge
where the sea meets the land, and remember its primary purpose: To help guide sailors and boaters home. Is there somebody in your life
that helps guide you home? To your authentic self? To the truth of who you are? To the person that you're meant to be? To the path that you're meant to be on? Picture that person now and consider the direction
that they're encouraging you to head in. The last item I'd like you
to picture is a disco ball. See the light bouncing off of it, think of the energy in the room
where you might find this unique object, maybe you hear
your favorite song playing. Is there somebody in your life
that reminds you of a disco ball? Somebody that shows up
with the fun, loving energy wherever they are, wherever they go? Picture that person now and consider how they are encouraging
you to live and love. Gently float open your eyes. Today I'd like to share a story with you
about a student of mine. His name was Daniel. I met Daniel the very first year
I was a classroom teacher. I had no experience as a theology teacher
in an all-boys prep school, and somehow this little guy,
this 103-pound wrestler, he became more of a teacher to me
than a student, because he showed me
and everybody in the school building how to shine their love and their light by being an example of how it's done. You see, the same year 
that I met this little guy was the same year
that I was cut from the NFL. Felt like a little bit of my light
had been taken from me when the Baltimore Ravens told me
I can no longer be their quarterback. I had trained with them all summer,
I felt like a kid in Disney, I was playing and competing
with some of my childhood heroes in stadiums
that I had only visited as a fan. Playing in the NFL
was an incredible experience, but at the end of the summer, a week before our first game,
on the last day of cuts, I was released. I had to return home to New Jersey 
to figure out a new career. I had graduated
from Georgetown University with the degree in psychology,
so I guessed I could teach that, but I was hired
at an all-boys prep school to coach football and teach theology. It was kind of like a life course
for the incoming freshmen. Gave me the opportunity to teach the guys the importance of being kind,
caring and thoughtful. It really healed my broken heart. I loved teaching 
as much as I loved playing football. And that's where I met Daniel. He came into my classroom
like a little disco ball. He had an energy and a light about him
that everybody wanted to be around. Daniel connected
with everybody in the school. I used to love watching him
walk the hallways. His smile was reflected back to him
in every corner. Athletes, band guys,
cool guys, smart guys, teachers and coaches, all felt the love of this pint-sized,
103-pound wrestler. People loved Daniel because he was free. He was free to be himself, and most of us know
how difficult that can be. I remember when Daniel
found out it was my birthday during his freshman year. He took it upon himself to create
a homemade birthday card for me. He even taped a Starburst candy
and a pack of Wrigley's gum to the inside. He presented it to me
in front of the class. Daniel was redefining cool, and he made it cool
to be thoughtful, caring and kind, and his classmates loved him for it. It was in this way
that our brotherly bond began. And it was during his sophomore year that Daniel started to campaign
for me to date his older cousin Lia, so that we could officially be family. (Laughter) He even brought her
to a wrestling match one weekend. I was only there
with about one other person, and Daniel had about 15 relatives
cheering him on that night. It was a beautiful night. Then Daniel came into school
the following Monday, and he was mad. He said, ""Mr. Ward, you brought
your girlfriend to my wrestling match, when I brought my cousin
to introduce you?"" (Laughter) I said, ""Wow, Daniel, hold on a second! That girl happens to be my younger sister, (Laughter) and, second of all, I didn't know you were trying
to play matchmaker that night."" It felt like a real compliment
to my teachings. My message of love and be loved
was really making an impact. For years, I've been practicing shouting commands
for the NFL football field, but I had been practicing
another message all along. I was never the type of football player
that was overly aggressive or tough. I never yelled at my teammates, and I never yell
at my students in the classroom. Some people say this may make
people walk all over you, but I believe otherwise. An older teacher once told me,
when I first began teaching, that I shouldn't smile in the classroom
until after a few months have gone by. (Laughter) I guess the theory is that the students
would think I was tough, but I love to smile, and I have a different theory. I believe that 
the toughest guy in the room is not the football guy; it's the loving guy. It's the most manly thing
that can ever be accomplished. It's not that difficult to do, but it requires great thought and courage. I loved football because I thought
it was one of the finest team sports. When we're on the field, playing together, relating as teammates, defending each other,
protecting each other, doing a little dance in the end zone
to celebrate the points we score - Football was really about relationships. And so is love. Love is a team sport. A team that we are all a part of. And on this team, Daniel is an all-star. But Daniel never had
the glory of an end zone dance, or even a dance at his junior prom. And that's because his life
extinguished way too early. One night, during Daniel's junior year, in February, he was rolling up the mats
with his wrestling buddies, and he collapsed in pain. Daniel suffered an aortic aneurysm, and he died
early the next morning in hospital. It was tragic. The date was February 7th, 2002. Exactly 12 years ago today. I don't think it's any coincidence
that I'm here today with the opportunity to share Daniel's story with you. Daniel is my lighthouse. When the water is dark and dangerous, the lighthouse can provide
a warm and inviting light, almost as if to say, this way home. Daniel brought me home
literally by bringing me to his home. The night after he died,
I visited his family, along with the number 
of other teachers from our school. We were all greeted
by Daniel's cousin Lia, who thanked us for being there
during such a devastating time. I introduced myself
as Daniel's theology teacher, and she replied, ""Oh, you're the one
that Daniel wanted me to marry!"" (Laughter) It was kind of like a light went on. I ended up sitting with Lia and her mom, sharing stories of Daniel
and looking at pictures. It was a really difficult time
for us both, but it hard for me not to notice that Lia had the same passion
and energy for life that I saw in Daniel. I wish he could have seen us meet. Riding home that night, I quietly recalled
my last moment with Daniel. He was visiting my class. And like many times before, Daniel would just stroll right in. And because I was sitting behind the desk,
he came over to me, and we're about the same height, and our shoulders bumped
into each other as we talked. I introduced him to the class as the 103-pound wrestler
who was having a great season, and the younger guys
just looked at him in awe. Here was this guy,
smaller than most of them, but he carried so much weight
and loving energy. On his way out 
of the classroom that morning, Daniel turned over his shoulder
in his cool little way and said, ""See you around, Mr. Ward."" Daniel died early the next morning. Couple of weeks later,
I thought I saw Daniel at school. The student was sitting
with [his] back to me, and it looked like Daniel. And for a moment
I believed that it was him. But soon the student stood,
and it obviously wasn't Daniel. But to me the message was clear. The same love and light that I witnessed 
and experienced in Daniel, could be found in everyone and everything. So I began to look for Daniel, to look for love
in everyone and everything, and at the crucial point in my life,
even in myself. Daniel was right when he said,
""See you around."" Because the same love in him
is within us all. Just as I tell my students back at school, there is so much goodness in you, and you are all, each and everyone of you, worthy of love and belonging, just as you are, imperfectly perfect. And once you begin open yourself to love, you will learn to see it everywhere, creating a peace, a freedom and a truth that will shift your overall,
entire experience. Think about it. If I stand right here
and I shift just a little bit, my view changes entirely. The same is true for love. If we can begin to make an effort to love and be loved
without any conditions, we will bring a whole new level of meaning to our relationships
and to our experience. I'm going to ask you
to close your eyes one more time. Picture the sun. Author Anthony de Mello writes: ""Has the Sun ever said
to the Earth: you owe me. Look what happens to a love like that.
It lights up the whole sky."" Is there somebody in your life
that can use a little unconditional love? Picture that person now. Remember the lighthouse. Remember its primary purpose:
To help guide sailors and boaters home. Is there somebody in your life
that can use a little guidance, a little direction? Picture that person now. And, lastly, picture the disco ball. Daniel was free to be himself because he loved himself unconditionally. We could all reflect 
a little bit of love back home, so that we can dance
like nobody is watching. Is there something in your life
that you've been waiting to do? Gently float open your eyes and smile. Twelve years ago, after Daniel died, I decided to ask his cousin Lia out
for dinner in his honor. We had so much to talk about, and I'm happy to tell you that,
four years after that, I asked Lia to marry me. She continues
to light up my life every day, Lia is my sunshine,
and now we have two sons. Our oldest is almost three,
and his name is John Daniel, whom we affectionately call J.D., and he's our little disco ball. We also have another son,
who is just 12 weeks old now. His name is Casey Christian,
and he's our little lighthouse. When people ask Lia if the boys will play football in the NFL
someday like their daddy did, she says, ""Maybe."" But our only wish for them
is to truly live a life where they can love and be loved. Thank you very much. (Applause)",{}

Old Love
yuji ft putri dahlia

when you were here
the stars disappear 
nothing can outshined the dress that you wear

we should be dancing
cause girl you look stunning 
Let’s spend the night together till reach the morning

I want to hold your hand and show what is love
when you’re smiling
and when you’re laughing 
we should keep dancing to treasure the feelings

like its the old love
(its the love love)
this is the way that we both wanna feel
under the moonlight we made our first kiss
cause this is the moment that you made me feel
like its the old love
(its the old love)
come on and hold me i want you right here
stay close to me so you dont feel the fear
i’ll never let go cause im just right here

when im with you
feels like deja vu
i realized that dreams really comethru
we keep on talking
for the moment we live in
let’s just keep drinking till moon disappear 

you are the one
the one that i want
the one that will stay by my side till im gone
the love of my live
and i’ll sacrifice 
just for the moment we last long forever

like its the old love
(its the old love)
this is the way that we both wanna feel
under the moonlight we made our first kiss
cause this is the moment that you made me feel
like its the old love
come on and hold me i want you right here

Lyrics:
I love you... I love you, I love you
Baby I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation and connection to the sun
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you and God who's my sunlight I'm blooming, grown so beautifully
Baby I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and misty world
I am in love with you (in love)
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (in love)
I'll never leave
Just keep loving me the way I love you loving me
I am in love with you (in love)
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (in love)
I'll never leave
Just keep loving me the way I love you loving me
And I know you love me, love me for who I am
Cause years before I became who I am, baby you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife and I see my whole future in your eyes
The thought of all my love for you, sometimes makes me wanna cry
Realize all of my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side
I am in love with you (in love)
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (in love)
I'll never leave
Just keep loving me the way I love you loving me
Every time I see your face, my heart smiles
Every time it feels so good, it hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love, to hold, to feel, to breathe
To live you
Dangerously in love, yeah
I am in love with you (in love)
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (in love)
I'll never leave
Just keep loving me the way I love you loving me
Dangerously (dangerously)
Dangerous, dangerously in love with you
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you.. oh yes..

Lyrics 

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring

And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up

Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken, one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words they always win, but I know I'll lose

And I'd sing a song, that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up

Oh oh
I wanna sing a song, that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love

Lyrics: 
Reckless Love
Written by Cory Asbury, Caleb Culver, and Ran Jackson

Verse 1

Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me

Chorus

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights ‘til I’m found, leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn’t earn it, I don’t deserve it, still You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

Verse 2

When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me
When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
You have been so, so kind to me

Bridge

There’s no shadow You won’t light up
Mountain You won’t climb up
Coming after me
There’s no wall You won’t kick down
Lie You won’t tear down
Coming after me",Bethel Music,"reckless love cory asbury,reckless love of god,reckless love bethel,cory asbury reckless love,reckless love live,Reckless Love,reckless love,wreckless love,bethel

the 99 to find the one every time so before i spoke a word [Music] before i spoke away you were singing over me and you have been so so good to me yes yes yes yes [Music] for i took a breath you breathe your life in me and you have been so so kind come on every voice lift it over [Music] leaves the 99 [Music] never reckless [Music] [Music] still your love [Music] when i felt no words you prayed it all for me yeah you did and you have been so so kind to me [Music] is oh god [Music] there's no shadow you won't light up mountain you won't climb up coming after me [Applause] there's no bar you won't kick down lie you won't tear down coming after there's no shadow there's no shadow you won't light a mountain you won't climb up coming after me there's no wall you won't get down [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] coming oh [Applause] is no [Music] yeah yeah i want to read this scripture to us is that a luke 15. sometimes people get confused by it but i feel like the lord's all over it tonight i want to read it to us [Music] wow [Music] it says now the text collectors and sinners are all gathering around to hear jesus the pharisees and teachers of the law of muttered this man welcomes the sinners and eats with them the religious people are mad it sets the stage and jesus pipes up he told them this parable says suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them doesn't he leave the 99 in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it and after he finds it he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and he goes home he calls his friends he calls his neighbors together and says rejoice with me because i found my lost sheep and i tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous people who don't [Music] man he's that good i want to just read a couple thoughts just share a little bit of the story behind this song and we'll sing that bridge one more time and we'll go nuts we'll see what happens so when i use the the phrase the reckless love of god when we say it we're not saying that god himself is reckless he's not crazy we are however saying that the way he loves is in many regards quite so what i mean is this he's utterly unconcerned with the consequences of his actions with regard to his own safety comfort and well-being his love isn't crafty or slick it's not cunning or shrewd in fact all things considered it's quite shock-like and might i even suggest sometimes downright ridiculous his love bankrupted heaven for you for me his love doesn't consider himself first it isn't selfish or self-serving he doesn't wonder what he'll gain or lose by putting himself on the line he simply puts himself out there on the off chance that you and i might look back at him and give him that love in return his love leaves the 99 to find the one every time and to many practical adults that's a foolish concept but what if he loses the 99 and finding the one right what if finding that one lost sheep is and will always be supremely important his love isn't cautious it's a love that sent his own son to die a gruesome death on a cross there's no plan b with the love of god he gives his heart so completely so preposterously that if refused we would think it irreparably broken yet he gives himself away again and again and again and again time and time again make no mistake our sins do pain as hard and 70 times seven is a lot of times to get your heart broken and yet he opens up and allows us back in every single time his love saw you when you hated him and all logic said they'll reject me he said i don't care what it costs me i lay my life on the line as long as i get their hearts to make it personal is love saw me a broken down kid with regret as deep as the ocean my innocence and youth poured out like water [Music] and he found me and he put me on his shoulders and he carried me on because he's just that good he's just that kind he's a father that never gives up so as we sing this bridge in chorus one more time just let it let it break down those walls tonight [Music] there's no shadow there's no shadow you won't light up mountain you won't climb up coming after me there's no wall you won't kick down lie you won't tear down coming after me yeah again there's no shadow you won't light up bouncing your own climber coming out he's breaking off self-hatred tonight there's no wall you won't kick down lie you won't stay down coming out there's no shadow now there's no shadow you won't light up bouncing you want come on let it rise there's no wall you won't kick down how you want come on declare it no shadow now there's no shadow [Applause] [Music] one more time love of god breakfast [Applause]

But as historian Douglas Brinkley points out, Dylan's love of movies has been a recurring theme in his art, and his persona, all his life.

crooked highs a new movie about Bob Dylan   starring Timothee Chalamet arrives in theaters 
Christmas day as historian Douglas Brinkley tells   us it's just the latest chapter in a lengthy 
love affair between Dylan and the movies growing up in the iron rich mining town of Hibbing 
Minnesota in the 1940s and '50s Bob Dylan was   not exposed to much non-conformity or social 
upheaval except that is at the movies [Music] rain it was at the local theaters one of which was 
owned by his relatives [Music] that he first set   eyes on Brigitte Bardot an early crush and Muse 
for some of his first songs he said my friend   Bob what do we need to make the country grow I 
said my friend John Brigitte Bardot I tried to   miss them and then he hit young Bob sported 
a leather jacket after seeing Marlon Brando   in the wild one you the big cop in the town when 
he saw the juvenile melodrama Blackboard Jungle   with its innovative rock 'n' roll soundtrack 
he reportedly said to a friend this is exactly   what we've been trying to tell people about 
ourselves there were other people why should   you be the only one involved but I am involved 
we are all involved seeing James Dean in Rebel   Without a Cause inspired him to stand up against 
the shackles of Cold War conformity in his music   of mothers and fathers throughout the land and 
all criticize what you can't understand once Dylan   made it to New York's greenage Village it was 
the art house International films that caught his eye Truffaut's shoot the piano player Fellini's 
La dolce vita that film about a tabloid journalist   searching in vain for fulfillment in a hedonistic 
Rome looked Dylan later said like life in a   Carnival mirror she looked like she stepped out 
[Music] of Dylan's first major film appearance   was a cameo in director Sam Peckinpah's 
Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid who are you   that's a good question the film spawned the 
classic song knockin' on Heaven's Door now   the Nobel laureate's most stream song knock 
knock knock on [Music] heaven's knock knock   knock his music has enhanced scores 
of movie scores from the big [Music] Lebowski to more recently St 
Vincent she said I'll give you shter one film stuck with Dylan for decades the older 
you grow the more you learn son now turn around   and head for the door well there was this movie 
I seen one time about a man riding across the   desert and it's starred Gregory Peck When Peck 
heard his name on Dylan's epic 1986 ballad   Brownsville girl he phoned him up to thank him 
Peck would reiterate his gratitude in 1997 when   he presented Dylan with the Kennedy Center Honor 
thank you Mr Dylan for rocking the country and the ages the new biopic a complete 
unknown starring an astounding   Timothee Chalamet is hardly the 
first cinematic depiction of Dylan but it's a reminder of 
the enduring and symbiotic   relationship between Dylan and the [Music] movies and a welcome excuse to revisit the 
work of this singular American Artist [Music]",{}

🎤 Lyrics: Tom Odell - Another Love

[Verse 1]
I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel all right
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

[Verse 2]
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hands been broken once, too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

[Bridge]
(Oh, need a love, now, my heart is thinking of)
I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

Lyrics:

I must be crazy now
Maybe I dream too much
But when I think of you
I long to feel your touch

To whisper in your ear
Words that are old as time
Words only you would hear
If only you were mine
I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do
And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side

I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

So today, I finally find the courage deep inside
Just to walk right up to your door
But my body can't move when I finally get to it
Just like a thousand times before
Then without a word he handed me this letter
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said

I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

Well maybe I, I need a little love yeah
And maybe I, I need a little care
And maybe I, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you
Oh you need somebody just to hold you
If you do, just reach out and I'll be there

I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

These three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Oh, I love you
Please say you love me too
Please please
Say you love me too
Till the end of time
My baby
Together, together, forever
Till the end of time
I love you
I will be your light
Shining bright
Shining through your eyes
My baby

Lyrics:
It must have been love
But it's over now

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love
But it's over now
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow
It must have been love
But it's over now
From the moment we touched
'Til the time had run out

Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I've turned to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love (must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now)
It was all that I wanted
Now I'm living without
It must have been love (it must have been love)
But it's over now

It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

It must have been love (must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now)
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow
It must have been love (must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now)
From the moment we touched
'Til the time had run out

Yeah, it must have been love (must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now)
It was all that I wanted
Now I'm living without
It must have been love
But it's over now

It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

Oh-oh (must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now), now
It must have been love (it must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now), now",Roxette,"Roxette,it must have been love,roxette it must have been love,it must have been love lyrics,roxette lyrics,roxette it must have been love live,it must have been love music video,80s soft rock,80s soft rock hits,90s soft rock hits,roxette greatest hits,roxette best songs,roxette 1990,pretty woman roxette,it must have been love pretty woman,pretty woman soundtrack",10,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music",2009-03-04T14:16:13Z,0:04:16,843373306,106603,True,[Music] day [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music],{}

Lyrics:

I know just how to whisper,
and I know just how to cry;
I know just where to find the answers;
and I know just how to lie.
I know just how to fake it,
and I know just how to scheme;
I know just when to face the truth,
and then I know just when to dream.
And I know just where to touch you,
and I know just what to prove;
I know when to pull you closer,
and I know when to let you loose.
And I know the night is fading,
and I know that time's gonna fly;
and I'm never gonna tell you everything
I've got to tell you,
but I know I've got to give it a try.
And I know the roads to riches,
and I know the ways to fame;
I know all the rules
and then I know how to break 'em
and I always know the name of the game.",AirSupplyVEVO,"AirSupplyvevo,vevo,official,video,music video,single,album,Making Love Out of Nothing At All,classic,Air Supply,Arista,Pop",10,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music",2011-03-23T10:34:26Z,0:04:53,393027257,50206,True,"(""Making Love Out Of Nothing At All"") ♪ I know just how to whisper ♪ ♪ And I know just how to cry ♪ ♪ I know just where to find the answers ♪ ♪ And I know just how to lie ♪ ♪ I know just how to fake it ♪ ♪ And I know just how to scheme ♪ ♪ I know just when to face the truth ♪ ♪ And then I know just when to dream ♪ ♪ And I know just where to touch you ♪ ♪ And I know just what to prove ♪ ♪ I know when to pull you closer ♪ ♪ And I know when to let you loose ♪ ♪ And I know the night is fading ♪ ♪ And I know the time's gonna fly ♪ ♪ And I'm never gonna tell you ♪ ♪ Everything I've gotta tell you ♪ ♪ But I know I've gotta give it a try ♪ ♪ And I know the roads to riches ♪ ♪ And I know the ways to fame ♪ ♪ I know all the rules and

[Verse]
I used to think that I wasn't fine enough
And I used to think that I wasn't wild enough
But I won't waste my time tryin' to figure out
Why you playing games—what's this all about?
And I can't believe you're hurting me
I met your girl, what a difference
What you see in her you ain't seen in me
But I guess it was all just make believe

[Chorus]
Oh love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found, found you

[Bridge]
Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
So empty, my heart, my soul, can't go on
Go on without you
My rainy days fade away
When you come around, please tell me, baby
Why you go so far away, why you go...

[Chorus]
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found, I found you

[Bridge]
(Ooh, what I know) I found you (Ooh)
Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
So empty, my heart, my soul, can't go on
Go on, baby, without you
My rainy days fade away
When you come around, say you're here to stay
With me, boy, I don't want you to leave me
I... I need you

[Chorus]
Love, never knew what I was missin' (I never knew)
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin' (I never never)
But I knew once we start kissin', I found, I found...
(We start kissin, I found, I found)
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found...

Lyrics:
Say you love me to my face
I need it more than your embrace
Just say you want me, that's all it takes
Heart's getting torn from your mistakes
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
And babe, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floating away
Just say you love me, just for today
And don't give me time 'cause that's not the same
Want to feel burning flames when you say my name
Want to feel passion flow into my bones
Like blood through my veins
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
And babe, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floating away
Won't you stay
Won't you stay
Slowly, slowly you run for me
But do you know me at all
Someone told me love controls everything
But only if you know
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
(No-no-no-no, no-no)
If you don't wanna try
(Could you try sometime?)
'Cause all that I've been thinking of
(I just think)
Is maybe that you might
(You might)
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
And babe, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floating away

🎤 Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I can't be your love
Look, it’s too trivial for you now
Oh, my life is fallin' apart
Maybe no one will notice if I disappear

[Chorus]
But I'll pray for you all the time
If I could be by your side
I’ll give you all my life, my seasons

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I can't be your love
'Cause I'm afraid I'll ruin your life
While the leaves withered away
And grew again
You have gone far away
I'll be pushing up daisies
And bring all the chances to here

[Chorus]
But I'll pray for you all the time
If I could be by your side
I'll give you all my life, my seasons
By your side, I’ll be your sеasons

[Outro]
My love

Lyrics:

Patta Anaaron Ka Patta Chinaron Ka Jaise Hawaon Mein
Aise Bhatakta Hoon Din Raat Dikhta Hoon Main Teri Raahon Mein
Mere Gunaho Mein Mere Sawabo Mein Shamil Tu
Bhooli Atthanni Si Bachpan Ke Kurte Mein Se Mil Tu

Rakhoon Chhupa Ke Main Sab Se Woh Laila
Maangoon Zamane Se Rab Se Woh Laila
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila 

Teri Talab Thi Haan Teri Talab Hai
Tu Hi Toh Sab Thi Haan Tu Hi Toh Sab Hai
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila

O Meri Laila Laila Khwaab Tu Hai Pehla 
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila (X2)

Maangi Thi Duwaen Jo Unka Hi Asar Hai Hum Sath Hain
Na Yahan Dikhawa Hai Na Yahan Dunyavi Jazbaat Hain

Yahan Pe Bhi Tu Hooron Se Zyada Haseen 
Yaani Dono Jahanon Mein Tumsa Nahi
Jeet Li Hain Aakhir Mein Hum Dono Ne Yeh Baaziyan 

Rakhoon Chhupa Ke Main Sab Se Woh Laila
Maangoon Zamane Se Rab Se Woh Lailan
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila 

Teri Talab Thi Haan Teri Talab Hai
Tu Hi Toh Sab Thi Haan Tu Hi Toh Sab Hai
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila

O Meri Laila Laila Khwaab Tu Hai Pehla 
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila (X2)

Zaiqa Jawani Mein, Khwaabon Mein Yaar Ki Mehmaani Mein
Marziyaan Tumhari Hon, Khush Rahoon Main Teri Manmaani Mein

Band Aakhein Karoon Din Ko Raatein Karoon
Teri Zulfon Ko Sehla Ke Baatein Karoon
Ishq Mein Un Baaton Se Hon Meethi Si Naraaziyan

Rakhoon Chhupa Ke Main Sab Se Woh Laila
Maangoon Zamane Se Rab Se Woh Lailan
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila 

Teri Talab Thi Haan Teri Talab Hai
Tu Hi Toh Sab Thi Haan Tu Hi Toh Sab Hai
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila

O Meri Laila Laila Khwaab Tu Hai Pehla 
Kab Se Main Tera Hoon Kab Se Tu Meri Laila (X2)

Lyrics :- 
Tum mile toh mil gaya yeh jahaan
Tum mile toh har pal hai naya
Tum mile toh sabse hai… faasla
Tum mile toh jaadu chaa gaya
Tum mile toh jeena aa gaya
Tum mile toh maine paaya… hai khuda

Come around… it’s time to baby
Come around..
Come on now… come around…
It’s time to baby… come around
Come around… come around

Palken moondein chaahat meri so rahi thi
Khushboo hawaaon mein thi
Maine nahin mehsoos ki
Mmm mm.mm
Jaane kahaan bahaaren meri khil rahi thi
Khushboo hawaaon mein thi
Maine nahin mehsoos ki

Tum mile toh mehki baarishen
Tum mile toh jaagi khwaahishen
Tum mile toh rangon ka hai silsila
Tum mile toh jaadu chaa gaya
Tum mile toh jeena aa gaya
Tum mile toh maine paaya hai khuda

Ta ra ra.. ta ra ri re… ta ra ra

Tune duaaein suni
Dil ki sadaiyen suni
Tujhse main maangu aur kya
Tujh bin adhura hun main
Tere sang poora hun main
Karta hun tera shukriya

Kaise kahoon, kaise kahoon…
Kaise kahoon…kaise kahoon…
Kaise kahoon lamhe mujhe choo rahe hain
Aisa laga hain inmein tera hi toh ehsaas hai
Ohh hooo
Kaise kahoon dil mein nayi aahaten hain
Aisa laga hain inmein tera hi toh ehsaas hai

Tum mile toh mera dil gaya
Tum mile toh sab kuch mil gaya
Tum mile toh logon se kya vaasta
Tum mile toh jaadu chaa gaya
Tum mile toh jeena aa gaya
Tum mile toh maine paaya hai khuda

Come around… it’s time to baby
Come around..
Come on now… come around…
It’s time to baby… come around
Come around… come around
Come around

Lyrics: 
I was all but 22
I think at the time
I’d been out on the road
Lonely at night
It’d been a while
So it was on my mind
Well I saw him walk in
With his cowboy hat
And I thought to myself
I could use some of that
His boots like glass on a saw dust floor
Had moves like nothin’ I’d ever seen before
So I walked right up
I pulled him to the side
I handed him a beer and looked him right in the eye
And I said “Baby, I think you’re gonna wanna hear this”
I said

Excuse me,
You look like you love me
You look like you want me
To want you to come on home
And baby I don’t blame you
For lookin’ me up and down across this room
I’m drunk and I’m ready to leave
And you look like you love me

Well I was down at the local beer joint with a few of the guys 
When this cute little country girl caught my eye 
And boy let me tell you she was the prettiest thing i’d ever seen in a pair of boots
Well she walked right up to me, handed me a beer 
Gave me a look like, lets get outta here 
And that's when I realized that she was every cowboys dream come true 
She told me this right here, she said..

Excuse me,
You look like you love me
You look like you want me
To want you to come on home
And baby I don’t blame you
For lookin’ me up and down across this room
I’m drunk and I’m ready to leave
And you look like you love me
So if you ever see a man in a cowboy hat

And you think to yourself
I could use some of that
Don’t waste your time
Just give ‘em this here line
Goes a little like this
Excuse me,
You look like you love me
You look like you want me
To want you to come on home
And baby I don’t blame you
For lookin’ me up and down across this room
I’m drunk and I’m ready to leave
And you look like you love me
I’m drunk and I’m ready to leave
And you look like you love me

Lyrics
An empty street, an empty house
A hole inside my heart
I'm all alone, the rooms are getting smaller.

I wonder how, I wonder why,
I wonder where they are
The days we had, the songs we sang together, oh, yeah.

And all my love, I'm holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far

So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue to see you once again, my love.
Over seas from coast to coast
To find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green to see you once again, my love.""",westlifeVEVO,"Westlife,Westlifevevo,vevo,official,video,music video,Westlife My Love Lyrics,single,album,My Love,Coast to Coast,pop,If Let You Go,You Raise Me Up,Fool Again,westlife,Flying without wings,my love,world of our own,What About Now,Uptown Girl,Westlife My Love,Westlife remix,westlife My Love official video,westlife album,westlife full album,westlife essentials,westlife full,westlife official audio",10,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music",2009-10-03T19:49:10Z,0:04:14,374608751,92694,True,"(plane roaring) - Freakin' lads.

🎤Lyrics: Keyshia Cole - Love

I used to think that I wasn't fine enough
And I used to think that I wasn't wild enough
But I won't waste my time tryin' to figure out
Why you playing games—what's this all about?
And I can't believe you're hurting me
I met your girl, what a difference
What you see in her you ain't seen in me
But I guess it was all just make believe


Oh love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found, found you


Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?

Go on without you
My rainy days fade away
When you come around, please tell me, baby
Why you go so far away, why you go...


Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found, I found you


(Ooh, what I know) I found you (Ooh)
Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
So empty, my heart, my soul, can't go on
Go on, baby, without you
My rainy days fade away
When you come around, say you're here to stay
With me, boy, I don't want you to leave me
I... I need you


Love, never knew what I was missin' (I never knew)
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin' (I never never)
But I knew once we start kissin', I found, I found...
(We start kissin, I found, I found)
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found...

사람 사이 사람
바람 사이 바람
각자의 염원이 바래고
덧칠되어

발이 닿을 만큼 굳어지면
비로소 내 세상이 되어줘

나의 작은 마음도
그 안에 자란 나음도
부서지고 굳어지고
녹아내리고나면
그제서야 보이는 나의 영원

사람 사이 사랑
모두 함께 모여서
영원을 바라고
몸 마음 묻어내면

비로소 우리의 세상이 완벽해
사랑으로
사랑으로

나의 작은 마음도
그 안에 작은 파도처럼
부서지고 밀려와선
네게 녹아내리고
그제서야 보이는 나의 영원

Lyrics:
There you were 
You’re gonna make a scene
comparing yourself to the person you were at age 17
I put my suit on 
and I tied my tie
I look like someone I don't recognize 

And it would be so much easier to love you 
If you could only see yourself like me
And wouldn't it hurt much less when you were lonely
If you could only see yourself like me?

I found a letter:
“Dear future me,
I promise I’ll take care of the person we’ll both be eventually
I’ll pick up painting, 
Oh! Oh – and I'll join the gym
I can't shake the feeling that I'll be happy by the time I'm him

And it would be so much easier to love you 
If you could only see yourself like me
And wouldn't it hurt much less when you were lonely
If you could only see yourself like me?

Please be disappointed in me
Isn’t it obvious I wasn't who you think?
And it would be ..

So much easier to love you if you could only see yourself like me
And wouldn’t it hurt much less when you were lonely
If you could only see yourself like me?

LYRICS:
Im just so fucking depressed

In my dreams is where I can find you
Remember, it was just us two. 
Even in my dreams, I made you see, 

In my nights of pain, 
you're just a memory.

You’re just another fucking memory

A kiss so fucking poisonous 
A lie so obvious, it's ruinous.
Now a number, a memory to hide, 
Locked away deep, in the back of my mind.

Let our love burn

How could someone so wonderful, so beautiful, so utterly free, 
Become so worthless to me?
Would you come and let our fucking love burn?

-
Love burn, love burn
Would you come and let our fucking love burn?
Love burn
Would you come and let our fucking love burn?

Our love is burning
and I don’t feel alright
Our love is burning
now break me down
-

Your ignorance, death of our love, so unfair, 
We found the feeling, lost in your empty stare.

And as we look out, we see us burn, i fell in love with you
And when the sun sets, you'll never return.

Tell me, Do you still think of me, huh?
during your silent nights?
'Cause you’re on my mind, when things are not right.
Would you now please come now and let our…

-
Love burn, love burn
Would you come and let our fucking love burn?
Love burn, love burn
Would you come and let our fucking love burn?

Our love is burning
I don’t feel right
Our love is burning
Now break me down
-

Oh break me down
break me down

My baby please break me down",PALEFACE SWISS,,10,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music",2024-12-04T23:01:06Z,0:04:28,162500,760,True,[Applause] [Music] [Applause] I'm just so far get that everybody can't remember it was me my dream I made you my [ __ ] that is so [ __ ] poisonous like so warious is ruinous now a number and high look away okay soone so wonderful so beautiful so want free because so what you [ __ ] what you [ __ ] love [ __ ] oh all love is burning and I don't feel all right all love is burning not rning back down with L and as we look out we see us SP I'm better love with you and when the [Music] sh tell me think of me huh your s night my with you my L [ __ ] want your come and let [ __ ] I don't feel right down [Music] [Music] oh please me oh greate [Music] [Applause] [Music],{}

🎤 Lyrics: Tom Odell - Another Love

[Verse 1]
I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel all right
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

[Verse 2]
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hands been broken once, too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

[Bridge]
(Oh, need a love, now, my heart is thinking of)
I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

🎤 Lyrics: Céline Dion - I Love You

[Intro]
I must be crazy now
Maybe I dream too much
But when I think of you
I long to feel your touch

[Verse 1]
To whisper in your ear
Words that are old as time
Words only you would hear
If only you were mine
I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do
And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side

[Chorus]
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

[Verse 2]
So today, I finally find the courage deep inside
Just to walk right up to your door
But my body can't move when I finally get to it
Just like a thousand times before
Then without a word he handed me this letter
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said

[Chorus]
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

[Verse 3]
Well maybe I, I need a little love yeah
And maybe I, I need a little care
And maybe I, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you
Oh you need somebody just to hold you
If you do, just reach out and I'll be there

[Chorus]
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

[Outro]
These three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Oh, I love you
Please say you love me too
Please please
Say you love me too
Till the end of time
My baby
Together, together, forever
Till the end of time
I love you
I will be your light
Shining bright
Shining through your eyes
My baby

About Ed Sheeran: 
Ed Sheeran may be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: an internationally acclaimed, multi-award winning singer/songwriter who seems to acknowledge no boundaries between styles or eras with elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock woven throughout his music.
